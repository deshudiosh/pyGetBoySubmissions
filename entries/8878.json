"description_html": "For the Solene Collection, BassamFellows created a summery suite of textiles appropriate for all climates. Inspired by traditional Scandinavian household linens and upholstery, the five woven patterns range from a small-scale plain weave reminiscent of sailcloth, to a chunky basket weave with greater depth of both color and texture. With a name derived from the Swedish word for \u201csun,\u201d the Solene Collection brings a lightness and freshness to the Geiger Textiles line, adding diverse choices while continuing to round out<br/>our foundational offer.",
