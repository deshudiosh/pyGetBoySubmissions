A entire block of massive brass was sculpted, chiseled with hands and transformed into the trunk of Bonsai. A lovely Charles homemade patina was applied on the trunk sculpture to enhance its texture details. 6 different leaf models were created to set a tree of 437 leaves made from brass casting. Each of the leaves were polished, gilded, manually burnished and mounted one by one according to the traditional way of bronze fitting in order to give to the future generations the opportunity to repair or restore the piece. The soil and the sand were also sculptured by hand, then gilded and burnished with Agatha stone. As for the pot, it\u2019s a original and traditional bonsai pot in terracotta, made by a Japanese potter. The chinese lacquered base, with gold leaves embedded on, is a piece designed from an original drawing of the Maple leaves of the Charles Paris.<br/><br/>Size : 23,6\u2019\u2019 x 31,5\u2019\u2019 x 23,6\u2019\u2019 (59,5 lbs)",
