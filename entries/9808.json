"description_html": "In response to ever-evolving needs in the workplace, Poppin\u2019s cleverly-designed Take Aim Coffee Table serves double duty as both a side table and a sporty regulation size cornhole game. The table seamlessly moves between functions, with flexible legs and an easy-to-slide circular unit at the table\u2019s summit to transition from leisure to performance in moments. The table\u2019s legs specifically underscore Poppin\u2019s engineering expertise, as the table is equipped with ingenious hardware that locks into an upright position for use as a flat surface and unfold for game play. A discreetly integrated storage drawer furthers the product\u2019s duality, providing grab-and-go access for the game\u2019s 8 regulation weight bags. Included in the set, the red and blue-hued cornhole bags underwent an intensive development phase to achieve the exact weight and feel of a traditional cornhole bag, while enhancing durability. Take Aim\u2019s clean design is highly adaptable, while also minimalistic in style, making for an ideal workplace addition. An Ash Wood Veneer surrounds the table\u2019s gently rounded silhouette for added appeal, while a protective stain prevents wear and tear.",
