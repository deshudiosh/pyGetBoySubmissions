"description_html": "Buoyant NYC is pleased to introduce the first of a series of cast glass fixtures that offer the signature sensibility already existing in our current collection. Inspired by our ancient history and objects often unearthed in the pursuit of understanding our past, this fixture collection aims to meld era's into a contemporary work.<br/>The HEIRLOOM / SLING cast glass series has a 6\"x6\" glass \u201cX\u201d shape with a<br/>hand-worked surface that hangs from leather slings. The casting process leaves natural inclusions within the glass giving these custom pieces a natural, found object quality. These pendants are illuminated by a 12v LED spot light available in different color temperatures.<br/>The brass or aluminum stem comes any length up to 4 ft. and can be finished<br/>in a clear satin, powder coat or Cerikote finish and is suspended from black power cord. The \u201cbelt weight\u201d leather slings can be dyed and finished in any color suitable for your project.<br/>July 13, 2017<br/>Some more information:<br/>- Cast glass can have either a sandblasted, kiln or polished finish.
