"description_html": "SoundStar\u00ae ceiling system\u2019s hexagonally shaped cellular coffers offer a scalable way to add geometric dimensionality and disrupt sound\u2019s ability to travel across a space. Each module is comprised of angled surfaces made from our Soft Sound\u00ae acoustical material (100% PET plastic with up to 60% recycled content), NRC rated up to 0.9, with a metal substructure. Choose from 12\u201d or 24\u201d deep hexagonal modules, 5\u2019 wide from edge to edge, and mix and match as desired. Thanks to its flexible, modular configuration, SoundStar\u00ae can adapt to a range of spaces and design visions, to create a spectacular visual effect. The design and sound capturing capabilities of this system offer a fresh effective approach to ultra-high performance sound attenuation.<br/><br/>SoundStar\u00ae offers an innovative combination of high-performance sound attenuation, and beautiful, faceted form, in an easy to use, highly scalable modular ceiling system. Its angled faces serve a dual purpose \u2013 bringing visual interest to spaces, through an interplay of light and shadow, and enhancing acoustic performance, allowing the system to better absorb and disperse sounds from all directions. With available joining brackets, modules can be interlocked flushly against one another to blanket spaces, or used flexibly as desired to fit any creative vision. Cluster units together, or suspend them at various heights. SoundStar\u00ae makes it easy to create an endless array of faceted layouts, tailored to the specific design and acoustic needs of a space.<br/><br/>SoundStar\u00ae offers a wide array of visual options, with Standard and Premium options available for both its steel substructure and Soft Sound\u00ae components. Choose from over 30 available Soft Sound\u00ae color variations, as well as a range of naturalistic wood textures. Or work with our Solutions Studio\u00ae team to build a custom graphic, texture, or color print to fit the specific needs of your project. All of SoundStar\u00ae's Soft Sound\u00ae faceted acoustical faces are made from majority post-consumer sourced, 100%, fully-recyclable, non-toxic PET plastic. These give SoundStar\u2122 light-weight, durability, and powerful sound attenuation, with minimal impact of the environment. Qualities like these combine in SoundStar\u00ae to make for a truly versatile, functional, and visually impactful ceiling system.",
