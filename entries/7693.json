"description_html": "Houdini Unlocked collection delivers the highest levels of visual and acoustic privacy. It also enhances interiors with its refined aesthetic and daylighting abilities. Houdini's fine linear texture obscures the shapes of people and objects to such an extent, they seem to disappear, transformed into abstract glimmers of light and motion. <br/><br/>This unique optical quality provides the ultimate balance of daylight and privacy. In laminated form, Houdini also adds sound control benefits. It is a cost-effective, foolproof alternative to complex daylight control devices. In opaque form \u2013 back-painted or laminated to mirror \u2013 Houdini Unlocked allows design professionals to extend the contemporary linear aesthetic to wall surfaces. The micro-fluted glass creates a crisp, sparkling appearance, adding dimension and rhythm to the space. <br/><br/>This collection can enhance any setting that calls for elegance and privacy, including healthcare, educational, and office facilities. The range of the new Houdini Unlocked Collection includes: ultra-clear (low-iron) and bronze laminated glass, woven patterns, plaid and chicken wire interlayers, back-painted colors, as well as gold and bronze mirror finishes.",
