"description_html": "Like flashes of rock fragments through a microscope, Breccia layers frame after frame of visual texture onto the wall \u2014 or ceiling. The hand-painted, hand-assembled collage of paper squares comes in four metallic colors, each named after a type of brecciated marble. From silver-lined Pernice to dark Nouvelle, the exclusive, 36 inch-wide, wallcovering from Innovations adds a unique, artistic touch to any space.",
