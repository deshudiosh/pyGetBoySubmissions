"description_html": "The OW124, designed by Ole Wanscher in 1951, is an elegant example of Wanscher's sculptural design, thanks in part to the unique, beak-like armrests that inspired the chair's nickname: the Beak Chair.<br/><br/>With its expressive silhouette and eye-catching details, the Beak Chair, exemplifies Ole Wanscher's commitment to exemplary craftsmanship and commitment to experimenting with design. With its distinctive armrests, which shoot out from the main frame, the Beak Chair demands exquisite materials and expert craftsmanship. The chair's soft, curved elements seamlessly join one another in an organic flow. Only the cover caps on the sides of the armrests are visible - a fine, functional, and decorative detail reminiscent of a bird's eye.<br/><br/>Carl Hansen &amp; S\u00f8n has worked closely with Wanscher's heirs to recreate the Beak Chair in accordance with Wanscher's original drawings. Available in oak, black-painted oak, or walnut with fabric or leather upholstery, the Beak Chair features natural, sustainable materials, suited for a variety of interiors.",
