"description_html": "Henrybuilt was founded in 2001 to create the first American kitchen<br/>\u2018system\u2019.\u00a0The\u00a0company\u2019s primary goal is to produce the best kitchen and whole house<br/>furniture and storage systems in the world, based on an ideal combination of system<br/>development, personal tailoring, craft quality and design service.\u00a0<br/><br/>The Vertical Bar Block was developed to bring utility to corners and small spaces, zones<br/>that prove challenging in kitchen design. The product includes an integrated electrical<br/>outlet, providing space for phone charging that keeps cords out of the way \u2013 as well as<br/>tailored storage for cutting boards, wine bottles, cooking tools, knives and trays. The<br/>Vertical Bar Block frees up valuable drawer space, while providing an additional<br/>aesthetic dimension. It can be specified in two heights \u2013 counter height and full height.<br/>The Vertical Bar Block advances the \u201ctool box\u201d concept introduced through the<br/>company\u2019s original Bar Block, but offers greater flexibility in how it can be programmed<br/>and allows users to reconfigure it as their needs evolve. Henrybuilt\u2019s systems approach<br/>to product design ensures a built-in level of aesthetic refinement, regardless of how the<br/>piece is configured. The Vertical Bar Block is hand made in Seattle using Paperstone and veneer core plywood.",
