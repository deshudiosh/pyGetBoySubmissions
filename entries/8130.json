"description_html": "Like weathered wood or stained concrete, Versa Wallcovering\u2019s Alley Cat has time-worn, artisanal appeal. Visually striking variegated, irregular brush strokes add movement and dimensionality to the wall. Ten inventive color palettes project industrial chic, weathered nature and rhythmic watercolor effects. Go subtle with tone-on-tone stone-washed combos, conjure urban attitude with lustrous metallic like Greyfitti, or go hip and bold with gold and black Mylars and funky fusions of fuchsia and silver. Low-VOC Alley Cat is made of Type II vinyl and is certified to NSF 342. Visit www.versawallcovering.com or contact Versa, 2301 River Road, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40206, (502) 458-1502.",
