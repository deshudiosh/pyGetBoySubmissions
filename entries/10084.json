"description_html": "Technology continues to redefine the way we engage, think and feel about interior spaces. The traditional modes of interaction in offices, schools and hotels are being transformed through new tools that enable rapid communication. With advancements in technology encouraging mobility and flexibility in workspaces, the importance of adaptable products is addressed through the Focus In collection. <br/> <br/>Multi-purpose environments that offer interchangeable work, meeting and social areas are now the norm. The aesthetic and performance qualities of products specified within these fluid spaces require an agility that supports a range of activities. The Focus In collection by Luum offers a collection of seven fabrics that reflect this nimble attitude.<br/> <br/>Outpress, Knurl and Amalgam are distinct upholstery fabrics that embody both high-performance and comfort. The multitasking textures and patterns of Navigate and Heather Felt offer more options to design seamless, transitional spaces when applied as both seating and vertical surfaces. Technoplaid, a wrapped-wall product, and Mica Shift, a direct-glue product, provide the opportunity for a dramatic focal point through the use of tape and metallic yarns.",
