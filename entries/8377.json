"description_html": "Adopting Artemide\u2019s guiding philosophy of \u201cThe Human Light,\u201d where lighting is a means of improving quality of life, Neri&amp;Hu\u2019s design is a poetic interpretation of the concept. The charming image of birds resting on scaffolding or chirping within a woven bamboo cage\u2014these are the delightful scenes of street life that one encounters daily in Shanghai. The collection, including pendant lamp, floor lamp, and table lamp, consists of black structures with brushed brass \u201cyanzi,\u201d or swallows, perched atop. Featuring two types of birds, an adjustable track system, as well as various extensions, there are endless possibilities to configure the light. With elegant lines and minimal shapes, Yanzi pays homage to both the urban and the natural, the rigid and the organic, while injecting a sense of playfulness into the design.",
