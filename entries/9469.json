"description_html": "Henrybuilt was founded in 2001 to create the first American kitchen \u2018system\u2019.\u00a0The\u00a0company\u2019s primary goal is to produce the best kitchen and whole house furniture and storage systems in the world, based on an ideal combination of system development, personal tailoring, craft quality and design service.\u00a0<br/><br/>The Functional Partition Wall was developed to provide elegant spatial screening within a kitchen area. The wall provides both privacy and transparency, creating distinct spaces without dividing them too harshly. One side of the wall is sculptural and quietly detailed. The other side - the 'working side' - can be attached to an island or peninsula, or can be free-standing in the room. The 'working side' can include an integrated outlet, knife storage, and recessed areas for things like keys. Shelves and pot racks are also options and can be easily switched in and out to change the functionality of the wall. The Functional Partition Wall is built as a piece of furniture, by hand, from solid wood, Paperstone and opaque white glass.",
