"description_html": "With a nod to Mid-Century Modern, this classic Sputnik-shape becomes fresh and modern with the addition of the wood components. The story of the tree is coded in each cut piece as every piece is meticulously cut and hand sanded to create a silky smooth surface to hand finish. The Honeycomb chandelier adds warmth and brightness to any interior with 12 lights totaling 720 watts of light. The chandelier is engineered of a wrought iron frame finished in rich antique brass and embellished with dark walnut cut in a honeycomb shape. <br/><br/>Designer Jamie Beckwith is known for her prestige wood surfacing treatments for both floor and vertical surfaces. Ms. Beckwith shares, \" I believe we are pushing boundaries with these new lighting concepts. We are taking a substrate that sometimes can feel bulky or heavy and reinterpreting it into a decorative element that truly is as beautiful as a crystal or a glass chandelier.\"<br/><br/>Jamie Beckwith Collection was inspired to take 2-dimensional wood components used for flooring and wall applications and create 3-dimensional ornaments for the collaboration with Currey lighting. The wood components were inspired by jewels and the intricate facets and bevels of fine cut jewelry.",
