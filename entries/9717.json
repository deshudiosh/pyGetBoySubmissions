"description_html": "The Powerful C-Table combines old and new materials and technologies for the ultimate in functionality. With its polished stainless steel base, this table gives the illusion of a floating marble top while discreetly concealing multiple power options. The top can rotate up to 360 degrees, allowing for a variable layout and exposing plug access for extra functionality. It measures 20\" long, 20\" wide and 23\" high. Custom materials and finishes available. <br/><br/>Integration has been taken to a whole new level and elegance with detailed incorporation of all that is needed for complex, yet simple to use power. \u00a0<br/><br/>\"Working with one of the highest quality manufacturers and suppliers of power devices, we developed a line of powerful tables with thin-profile USB and outlets and achieved metal and colored faceplates matching the product,\" said acclaimed interior architect Lauren Rottet. <br/><br/>The piece is designed to change out the power if it goes obsolete and is durable enough to last for years -- the ultimate sustainable approach.",
