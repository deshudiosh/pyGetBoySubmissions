"description_html": "Bevy is a dynamic table platform that enables users to configure to their hearts\u2019 delight. Designed for sitting, standing or perching, the collection easily solves any spatial configuration. Six table heights, as well as a range of top sizes, offer a bounty of permutations to create spaces that allow heads-down focus, or for holding court. Bevy re-imagines the workplace from the ground up. Multiple base options, a range of tabletop shapes and a variety of finishes offer seemingly endless customizable options that create surface appeal with a deeper cultural meaning.<br/><br/>Personalization within each configuration is the ultimate goal attained by Bevy. Four base finishes including polished aluminum and three powder-coat colors provide durability in high-use areas like caf\u00e9s and dining spaces. Five different top surface finishes create a wide array of choice. A substantial frame under-structure allows for easy wire management, along with providing strength and stability.<br/> <br/>Bevy is constructed with aluminum, steel, solid wood with its top surface materials including laminate, surface leather, solid surface, glass and veneer.",
