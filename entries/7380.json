"description_html": "Glamora is a laboratory where graphic design, elegant craftsmanship and material constitute a single<br/>language, able to transform space with great narrative and emotional value.<br/>Glam-Metal represents a new expression of this global search: a vinyl covering, lined with a thin metallic layer<br/>that lends the wallcovering the shine and reflection of metal. Like a delicate material weaving together of fine<br/>threads, Glam-Metal elicits particular visual and tactile sensations, making the graphics even more arresting<br/>and every environment even more prestigious.<br/>Suitable for covering interior walls and ceilings, the Glam-Metal material can be combined with all subjects in<br/>Glamora\u2019s vast collection of wallcoverings, playing on its affinity and contrast with themes ranging from ethnic<br/>to industrial, vintage to contemporary, and natural to material.",
