Acoustic sheers by Vescom are a great solution for these types of floorplans because they are able to cancel out noise while remaining atmospheric.\u201d Marybeth Shaw, VP, Design and Marketing.<br/> <br/>Drapery Sheers<br/>Wolf-Gordon now offers Acoustic sheers by Vescom that have a lightweight appearance while maintaining excellent sound absorption. The translucent draperies trap and eliminate sound when applied 5-7 inches from a surface such as glass, concrete or drywall. The curtain fabrics are extremely thin, and possess strong resistance to daylight and colorfastness.<br/><br/>The distinctive sheers come in the lovely Carmen, Marmara and Formoza designs. Carmen has a fluted texture with a shimmering surface, while Formoza has a more industrial look with stitching that runs the length of the fabric. Marmara resembles an elegant lightweight wool.",
