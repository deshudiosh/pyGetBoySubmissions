"description_html": "Through the language of textiles, Joan Gaspar has designed a fixture of flexible, ductile materials that sifts the light as readily as it moves with the wind. In the Jaima collection, the light is the shade and weaver of emotions.<br/><br/>This new collection takes its name from the Bedouin tents of North Africa, and is inspired by their varied fabrics and forms. The textilene shade is available in three sizes and four different colors, with an off-white interior to optimize the quality of the downward light.<br/><br/>The shades can be combined with two versatile stands to make various sizes of adjustable, rotating floor lamps; the fixture can also be a affixed directly to the floor or wall, and the shades can be hung independently as pendants.",
