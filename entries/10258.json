"description_html": "Blending inspiration from both timeless residential and contract design, Gunlocke\u2019s new Tia wood seating collection explores and celebrates elegant simplicity and the heart and soul of traditional woodcraft \u2013 the foundation on which Gunlocke was built.<br/><br/>Designer David Mocarski of Arkkit Forms Design envisioned the furniture equivalent of the \u201clittle black dress\u201d when he sat down to create Tia\u2019s guest chair and counter- and bar-height stools. The result is is seating that\u2019s at home in any space. <br/><br/>I wanted my inspiration to be an exercise in subtlety Mocarski says. \u201cIt also was essential that the design have a unique personality. Profile, silhouette and proportion drove the design.\u201d<br/><br/>In bringing the Tia collection to life, Mocarski sought to create a \u201cconversation\u201d between the seating area and the wooden frame. He achieved this goal by designing a seat and back in one single shape.<br/><br/>Tia is available in a maple or ash hardwood frame in any of Gunlocke\u2019s standard finishes, while its seat and seatback can be clad in any of the company\u2019s fabric or leather options.",
