"description_html": "Looking to Hollywood, which has entertained, engaged and inspired the world from the silver screen to the comfort of home since the 19th Century, McGuire Furniture sought to make big dreams a reality for the Spring 2017 collection with pieces steeped in glamour and refinement with an eye towards what\u2019s ahead. McGuire\u2019s designers used the core materials that have come to define the company over the past 70 years, along with the specialized craftsmanship that brings those materials to life in truly innovative ways. New shapes carved in rattan, bamboo seating, caning with a twist, brass bands, and shapely concrete make bold statements and create a cast of characters that are McGuire\u2019s future.<br/><br/>The Manau Nomad Chair pushes the boundaries of form and function, using McGuire's legacy material to create a timeless, yet timely piece that will stand out in any room. Named for the Indonesian word for rattan, the Nomad Chair's unique shape is emphasized by its herringbone caning and bold star-shaped base in Blonde Brass finish. The pronounced circular arm, wrapped in signature rawhide, evokes a classic mid-century modern aesthetic, which invites luxurious comfort and style into any home. Fully customizable in Type I-V finishes. Tight seat in COM/COL. Brass plated stainless steel base with Blonde Brass finish; 5 brass casters with rubber.",
