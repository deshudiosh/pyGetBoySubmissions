"description_html": "\u201cShadow owes its birth to light.\u201d \u2013 John Gay<br/><br/>The interplay of light and shadow to create an artful display of actively shifting shapes is uniquely illustrated through Emser Tile\u2019s multidimensional tile series, Code. Minimal and neutral forms offer endless designs of large-scale wall art with flat, faceted, and reflective variations in surface, shape, and texture.\u00a0<br/><br/>Three tile shapes include a hexagon, wedge, and trapezoid. Hexagon and wedge shapes are available in nine 2D, 3D, and textural takes, from smooth to lines in bas relief and metallic matte finishes. Flat trapezoid tiles allow for unique compositions on the wall and floor simply by orienting tiles in various degrees. <br/><br/>Flexible tile formats invite designers to test the limits of their creativity\u2014the ability to form unique overarching pattern through the very way in which they integrate and orient tiles unleashes enormous design potential. Strategically mix flat and dimensional tile patterns on the wall to create large-scale art with transforming texture, or move from the floor up to and throughout the wall in a single shape for a clean, angular aesthetic on multiple surface planes.",
