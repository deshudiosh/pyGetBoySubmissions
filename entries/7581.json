Objects that express their spirit. Their individuality. <br/><br/>With a newly-released line of premium accessories\u2014Hand &amp; Craft\u2014Byrne has partnered with skilled local artisans to produce exclusive, hand-made designs that combine the modern necessity of access to power and USB with artfully-crafted, uniquely personal pieces that are distinctly at home in the home.<br/><br/>The Hand &amp; Craft offering was launched as six select products\u2014all special in creation and construction\u2014with materials that speak for themselves. Cast iron and concrete. Leather and marble. They offer an honesty aesthetic that runs luxuriously against the grain.<br/><br/>The inspiration for these pieces is drawn from the many craftsmen who came before us, and they are constructed\u2014with purpose\u2014by individuals who embrace the beauty in details often overlooked.<br/> <br/>When you hold a Hand &amp; Craft accessory, you understand it to be a celebration of originality, artistry and attraction.<br/><br/>And a collection as enduring as it is new.",
