"description_html": "Lagoon: The color moods of the ocean \u2013 captured in the sheer fabric LAGOON. Dreamy sunsets, dark moonlit nights and cool morning moods were the inspiration for the soft, flowing color gradients of LAGOON. A digital printing process gives the sheer Trevira CS basic fabric a continuous pattern with a three meter repeat. This special sheer fabric is available in five different multi-colored designs. <br/><br/>Helsinki, London, San Francisco, Melbourne and Barcelona: A journey through the trendiest city districts was the inspiration for a fashionable, diverse collection. <br/>With so much expressiveness and excitement, THE VENDEVOORT revitalizes not only hotels and hospitality projects, but also private interiors. All fabrics are made from flame-retardant polyester FR or Trevira CS and come in colors ranging from bold hues to subtle shades of soft pastels. This is a collection that is as individual, significant and authentic as the people who are surrounded by it. Welcome to the SAHCO boutique hotel THE VENDEVOORT.",
