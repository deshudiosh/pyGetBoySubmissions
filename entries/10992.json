"description_html": "The perfect marriage of two substrates creates a bond of beauty and long-lasting durability. An intricate layer of lace is laminated to a strong non-woven substrate. The lace resists pigment during the coloring process creating stunning depth and texture. The organic and rhythmic pattern also provides an almost seamless installation. With 12 colorways to choose from, Unveil adds subtlety and sophistication to any setting.",
