"description_html": "The Frequency rug in Impressionistic designed by Crosby Street Studios is made from semi-worsted wool and can be custom colored. The design is inspired by sound waves and computer glitches. The design team \"wanted to take a seemingly simple design with a minimal color palette, and push the technique of the hand-tufted carpet.\" Each of the thin lines in the design is made by twisting different ends of colored wool yarn-showing the genuine artistry of the tufters.",
