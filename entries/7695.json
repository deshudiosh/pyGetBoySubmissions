"description_html": "Three partners have come together to develop a series of lights that offer intelligence and simplicity\u2014Richard Meier, the Pritzker-Prize winning architect, Ana Meier, a product designer with a strong modernist voice, and Herv\u00e9 Descottes, a lighting master. The timeless yet forward thinking collection represents a shared ideology from all three designers.<br/><br/>Developed using primarily Corian and a range of materials including aluminum, steel, and hand blown Venetian glass, the collection consists of sculptural sconces as well a variety of product types including globe pendants, floor lamps, and table lamps.<br/><br/>\u201cWith this collection, we aim to bring the power of architecture to a smaller-scale. I was moved to take recurring themes and forms in Richard\u2019s work, and translate them into sculptural objects that are interacted with everyday.\u201d -Ana Meier<br/><br/>\u201cThese pieces provide a new experience of space, where the user carefully controls the interplay of form and shadow. The designs reveal a dialogue between geometries at different scales, while retaining the precision so distinctive of Richard\u2019s cannon of work.\u201c -Herv\u00e9 Descottes<br/><br/>\u201cArchitecture has the power to inspire, to elevate the spirit, to feed both the mind and the body. With this collection, we have distilled this feeling into objects...\u201d \u2013Richard Meier",
