"description_html": "Boom is a new series of LED chandeliers with explosive forms made from and inspired by destroyed buildings. Designed by RUX, a multidisciplinary design firm based in New York City, Boom features cast-brass joints and linear wooden bulbs to create forms of exploding light, and is available in two configurations - Single Boom (which comes in three sizes: Little, Middle &amp; Big) and Double Boom - in polished brass and custom finishes.<br/><br/>The expressive form of Boom is achieved with minimal elements. At the center of the fixture is a singularity of cast-brass joints, elegantly curved to dramatically reflect the geometry of the fixture. Linear wooden bulbs \u2013 the essence of all Stickbulb designs \u2013 in varying lengths cantilever from the brass core, each one emitting a line of even light in a different direction. The result is an explosion of richly textured wood that casts dynamic patterns of light and shadow.<br/><br/>Boom is presented in a new wood type, Water Tower Redwood, which is sourced from dismantled water towers in New York City. The reclaimed wood is rich and red in color and threaded with occasional black veins. Years of exposure to sun, wind, rain, and snow on one side and contact with water on the other have resulted in a material with unique color banding that is full of character and strikingly beautiful.",
