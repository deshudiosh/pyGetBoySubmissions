"description_html": "Seating 8, the DT-03 is designed to explore the material possibilities of stone and steel. The graceful bends and lustrous blackened finish of the steel base yield an unexpected softness that supports a stone top, dramatically shaped to minimize the appearance of its edge. Tapering from 3/8\u201d at the edge to two inches at the base, the solid marble top is finished with a high gloss polish on all sides. This finish visually extends the steel legs as they are reflected on the underside of the tabletop- an effect that blurs the lines between top and plinth, visually deconstructing the expected relationship between the top and its support.",
