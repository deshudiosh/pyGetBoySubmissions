"description_html": "Northern Lights, an intriguing kinetic sculptural lamp, was designed by interior designer, architect and artist Sherry Williamson. As a floor or table lamp, the fixture transforms the mood and environment in the space it occupies. <br/><br/>Williamson has designed custom lighting for over 20 years, and was inspired to create Northern Lights as an off-shoot of her ongoing series of whimsical wood, wire and ceramic sculptures.<br/><br/>The design for Northern Lights balances a minimalist machined aesthetic with hand-crafted elegance.<br/><br/>Williamson chose a small team including Phoenix Day Lighting, the venerable family-owned San Francisco manufacturer, to fabricate the unusual fixture. Phoenix Day\u2019s skilled team of artisans calibrated and machined the refined components of Northern Lights, bringing the design to life.<br/><br/>The poetic lamp features a hand-thrown and glazed ceramic cylinder base topped by a polished nickel disk with an array of 240 gently waving stainless steel rods. A powerful custom LED light source spills an ever-changing array of luminous hues up through the wires and onto the walls and ceiling above, reaching 15 feet or more.<br/><br/>The fixture measures 45\u201d in height, is 10\" in diameter and is compliant with UL 2108 Low Voltage and 8750 LED standards.<br/><br/>http://bit.ly/2fLxQY5",
