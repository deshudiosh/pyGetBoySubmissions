"description_html": "The newest generation of ONDARIA circular ambient luminaires features an ultra-thin 2\u201d profile, direct / indirect distributions and exquisite detailing. ONDARIA feels like a skylight, delivering unmatched homogeneous illumination with wide-area lighting that makes rooms appear larger and wider. Whether recessed, surface-mounted, wall-mounted or as a pendant luminaire \u2013 the clear geometry of ONDARIA enhances the architecture without detracting from the interior styling. This makes it just as attractive for reception and waiting areas as for break-out zones or general lighting in a retail environment. The round shape of ONDARIA means that it can be positioned at random and in any direction in a room, without compromising the constant quality of light. An unobtrusive indirect light component with separate switching brightens ceilings and produces gentle ambience.<br/><br/>ONDARIA is available in three sizes \u2013 24\u201d, 34\u201d and 45\u201d. Optical lens offerings include the Luminance-Reducing Optic (LRO) for office environments and a soft Opal Optic for multiple applications such as lobbies, healthcare, educational facilities and retail. The innovative LRO achieves a low Unified Glare Rating (UGR) &lt; 19, making it suitable for workplace applications where visual comfort is a concern. Both optics offer an unobtrusive indirect light component with separate switching, which brightens ceilings and produces gentle ambience.<br/><br/>ONDARIA is comprised of a white enamel aluminum housing with soft outlines. White is the standard finish color, but custom colors are available. The inner surface of the luminaire is painted with a highly reflective finish for increased efficiency, achieving efficacy of up to 101 lm/W.",
