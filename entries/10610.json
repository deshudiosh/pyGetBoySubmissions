"description_html": "The Firefly Collection is entirely made of porcelain, which is something unique in the world of lighting. In addition, they are portable and self-sufficient energy-wise. These models are even unique within the Lladr\u00f3 Lighting catalog, because they respond to two challenges. Firstly, to create a lamp with a lithophane shade and with a more intense light than emitted by out lithophane. Secondly, for the lamp to work without having to plug it in. <br/><br/>The plant patterns update the classic tabletop lamp in the language of porcelain and with a wide variety of colors from the Lladr\u00f3 palette. <br/>The magical ability of fireflies to cast light on their own is the inspiration behind the name of this collection of portable, battery operated table lamps. The decor on these lamps features vegetation motifs that bring to mind the shape of such plants as palm trees, cactus and lotus flowers. <br/><br/>With these creations, Lladr\u00f3 explores new forms to deploy its full artistic and functional potential. Here the brand applies its control of porcelain techniques in its line of lighting products, combining unique range of colors with porcelain. Everything comes together to achieve a novel, modern collection.",
