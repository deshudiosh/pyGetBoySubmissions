"description_html": "BuzziSpace has always been a strong brand. It became known for its products, which stood out from the crowd due to their design, functionality and sustainability. Over the last ten years, BuzziSpace has been in a constant state of innovation, releasing more than 80 new product families. As a young and rapidly growing company, the rate of product development often moved faster than the marketing materials could keep us with. The focus had always been on tradeshows, where BuzziSpace first made a name for itself.<br/><br/>Building on two strong building blocks: product and tradeshow presence, it was time to move the BuzziSpace brand forward. Under the leadership of Els Kerckhof, marketing director, the team setout to to create a comprehensive and cohesive brand experience. The aim was to generation brand recognition on a daily basis, rather than at just a couple events a year. <br/><br/>The first step was to build brand guidelines for BuzziSpace\u2019s MarComm team and ambassadors to refer. Every touch point with BuzziSpace needed to breathe the brand image \u2013 a combination of the company\u2019s own font, corporate colors and signature imagery.<br/><br/> At NeoCon 2017, BuzziSpace unveiled a full marketing suite, which included a full catalog, postcards and notecards, as well as an interactive ten-year timeline wall graphic, which became a focal point of their award-winning showroom display, as well as branded content including the BuzziGazette \u2013 all 100% designed in-house by BuzziSpace.",
