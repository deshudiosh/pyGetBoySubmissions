"description_html": "Bolon Duet represents a move toward experimentation not only in form \u2013 the collection of soft rugs is a first for Bolon \u2013 but also in material; the rugs are Bolon\u2019s first foray into textile production and present a new material comprised of vinyl thread woven with wool and sparkling, metalized polyester. The result is soft and tactile while retaining the durability for which Bolon is celebrated. Like Bolon\u2019s tile and roll flooring, Bolon Duet rugs are designed to be flexible around the needs of its user and can be layered for dimensional effects, inviting users to play and experiment with their floors in countless configurations. Duet features a palette of muted tones in deep blues, grays and greens. Duet is available in four styles (Glow, Midnight, Stripe Forest, Stripe Ocean) offered in subtle stripe patterns and solids.<br/><br/>\u201cAt Bolon, we have always followed our own path and applied a fearless, inquisitive approach to developing our brand and products,\u201d says Annica Eklund, who with her sister Marie Eklund is a third-generation owner of Bolon. \u201cThe products and collaborations we\u2019re planning to unveil in 2017 are an expression of this curiosity. There have been twists and turns, but it has been in those unplanned detours that our spirit of experimentation and innovation has been released.\u201d",
