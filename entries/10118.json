"description_html": "When Bentley designs a new collection, it\u2019s much more than the right combination of texture, color and material. It\u2019s an extension of the brand and what differentiates the California-based commercial carpet manufacturer. And it\u2019s not just physical product, either. It\u2019s a story that resonates through everything. (los)t angeles is case in point. From the pattern names to the NeoCon experience, it was never \u201cjust carpet.\u201d (los)t angeles is a vibe. The Bentley vibe. <br/><br/>Not long ago, Bentley returned to its roots, taking a wide-angle, big picture view of Los Angeles\u2019 (L.A.) influence on its people and products. With the launch of (los)t angeles, it contrived the next chapter of its L.A. narrative \u2013 inspired by the sprawling, open book city that somehow manages to be gritty and razor-sharp while living up to its laid-back, sun-drenched bohemian reputation.<br/><br/>The modular and broadloom collection\u2019s branding and marketing material played on this story of reinvention, going beneath the glitz and behind the urban decay to help others discover the extraordinary and unexpected things. <br/><br/>Officially available to the market in January 2017, (los)t angeles debuted at NeoCon 2016. Known for crafting unique showroom experiences, Bentley didn\u2019t simply display the two carpet styles (Underground and Trespass); it invited showgoers into a journey of juxtaposition. Conquest and sin; loss and growth; decay and renewal. As you moved along, the showroom\u2019s look and feel shifted from old and run-down to moderately built to a completely renewed structure \u2013 a reflection of L.A.\u2019s everchanging landscape. Mexican coffee, local California Lagunitas beer and branded flask water bottles (a designer favorite!) were added touches of Bentley\u2019s (los)t angeles flare. <br/><br/>Across the street at the company\u2019s secondary showroom, visitors discovered their own story with an aura reading/photography station. Multiple giveaways, including opportunities to receive inspirational Giving Keys necklaces \u2013 with proceeds supporting L.A.\u2019s homeless community \u2013 reinforced Bentley\u2019s (los)t angeles narrative. <br/><br/>The branding and marketing campaign continued into 2017 with eye-grabbing \u201clook books\u201d of inspiration photos shot by the product designer himself. The barren Salton Sea and the abandoned zoo, among other \u201cforgotten places,\u201d offered an eerily edgy yet oddly elegant view into the textures, colors and energy that inspired the collection. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, advertisements featured vibrant blue broadloom carpet draped in an industrial-looking factory, thinly veiled with smoke \u2013 a mix of old and new, forgotten and found elements. Exciting yet unexpected. The ads and collateral, PR, social media and event experiences were united by more than the one product they were designed to showcase. They were all unmistakably Bentley. <br/><br/>Every Bentley marketing and branding campaign, but perhaps especially that of (los)t angeles, serves to cement its story: the L.A. vibe, the collision of new and old, strange yet brilliant, lost but always found.",
