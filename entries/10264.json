"description_html": "SIXINCH presents a unique line of chairs and tables called Tauko. Designed by Mac Stopa, the Tauko collection is inspired by designs from the 1950s and 1960s that match the home office design trend perfectly. <br/><br/>The collection is characterized by soft, aesthetically pleasing organic shapes and high-quality wooden elements. The wide palette of finishes, including natural wood, laminate and range of upholsteries envelope color concepts that harmonize with the new color trends - making the Tauko Stool an ideal guest chair solution for offices and hospitality environments. <br/><br/>The chair has a unique seat that consists of two halves fastened together at the bottom, producing an interesting visual effect. Full seating comfort is ensured by the well-contoured line of the chair bucket. The Tauko Chair is well-suited for office meeting rooms and cafeterias, hotel bars, cafes and restaurants, as well as for public spaces, including building lobbies and airport waiting areas.",
