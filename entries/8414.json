"description_html": "The Retreat Collection from Allsteel is a family of upholstered, space-defining lounges that works to solve the<br/>problem of underutilized social and collaborative settings. Designed by Niels Bendtsen of<br/>Bendtsen Design Associates, the Retreat portfolio combines Bendtsen\u2019s expertise in successful<br/>residential design with Allsteel\u2019s understanding of real workplace issues.<br/><br/>Retreat lounges\u2014a wing-back, a high-back, a low-back and an ottoman\u2014work to solve the<br/>challenge of underutilized social and collaborative areas. The Retreat lounge has a refined, residential look, thanks to Bendtsen\u2019s long experience creating timeless pieces in the category. But drawing on its office-practice and ergonomics expertise, Allsteel has made the chair\u2019s geometry, size and scale ideal for comfortable work. <br/><br/>Used in multiples, Retreat provides small working groups with an equivalent sense of defined<br/>private space where collaborative tasks requiring focus can be accomplished in comfort. The<br/>swivel base allows individuals to engage or disengage with others in the team at will, while the<br/>standard return-to-center mechanism means that after use, any arrangement of seats is left neatly<br/>aligned ready for the next occupants. Other base options include free swivel and glides.<br/>Lightweight and easy to move, Retreat\u2019s coordinating family of wing-back, high-back, low-back<br/>and ottoman options not only allows for many possible applications\u2014a four-pack grouping of<br/>wing backs for optimum space definition; a side-by-side pairing of swivel low backs for a more<br/>open feel; a wing back and ottoman for a feet-up, individual retreat, and more\u2014but also<br/>maintains a consistent aesthetic across the workplace. <br/><br/>Allsteel worked closely with its clients on the geometry and scale of the lounges to best support active work while maintaining a more residential feeling of style and comfort. \u201cThe organic-inspired silhouette of Retreat\u2019s three lounges and corresponding ottoman is refined but approachable,\u201d said designer Niels Bendtsen. \u201cThe collection offers designers and architects the opportunity to create quietly distinctive environments that combine inviting<br/>aesthetics with work-friendly functionality. And because the pieces are compact, they can also be<br/>set along windows or in corridors and other underutilized areas, maximizing available space for<br/>offices.\u201d",
