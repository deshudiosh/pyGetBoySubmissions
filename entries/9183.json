You can fly on a carpet or chill on the sand while sitting in it.<br/>Its design is inspired by the great journeys of the desert tribes, during which men feel close to the earth, rest on it and merge with the landscape.<br/>Babu is a spot for relaxation and meditation; a place to rest, a shelter. <br/><br/>Babu is born straight from Jordi Ribaud\u00ed\u2019s soul, in Igualada, Barcelona. The town has strong roots in the local leather industry, and the company\u2019s headquarters is to be found in a restored nineteenth century tannery.<br/>His work is inspired by his passion for leather works. He looks for new purposes of the material in order to create innovative -and exciting- shapes and feels.<br/><br/>Materials<br/>Babu takes shape from a single 6mm-thick leather piece, which folds back on itself to create the backrest. Some small brass feet keep the structure together.<br/>The leather, vegetable-tanned and wax-finished, is available in four different aniline colours: na\u00actural, brown, hazelnut, and black.<br/>The seat cushion is available in cotton velvet and leather.",
