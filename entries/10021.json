"description_html": "ICE OF GENESIS<br/>ICE OF GENESIS is the beginning of everything, the origin of nature, and of matter. The origin of an idea, a creative process, that seeks to change the status quo of surface coverings. It is the most ambitious collection from COMPAC, offering a series of surfaces in which technology, design and art come together to create something that has never been seen before.<br/>For such an inspiring endeavour, we collaborated with a truly disruptive and transgressive mind: the designer and artist Arik Levy. <br/>ICE OF GENESIS is the result of the huge challenge of creating a material that has depth but is also flat and resistant. Imitating the feeling of walking on ice, exquisitely balanced between fragility and stability.<br/>Inspired by the great ice lakes that can be found in the Arctic, ICE OF GENESIS reveals on its surface visual fragments similar to those produced by natural stone, causing the eye to delve into ethereal qualities and surprising material transparency. <br/>The goal was to create warmth, coolness and abstraction. The black pieces are abstract; the red ones represent the warmth of the earth, whereas white speaks of coldness. Whatever they say, they all produce a sense of depth, responding to parameters that seem unknown in the visual sense, but are closely connected to the collective memory of our very natures. <br/>Available designs: Ice Black and Ice White in polished and glac\u00e9 finishes, size 128\u201dx63\u201d, thicknesses \u00be\u201d and 1 \u00bc\u201d.",
