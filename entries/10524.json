"description_html": "Each piece of the Freya Hardware Pull series is masterfully hand-crafted out of genuine, sustainably-sourced horn. Paying homage to earth\u2019s bounty of elements and organic sophistication, the unique tonal, natural beauty of horn resonate against hand-cast metal. The Freya Pulls are offered in both light horn and dark variegated horn, in many sizes and metal finishes, and made locally in Matthew Studios' Harlem, NY studio.",
