"description_html": "In our steadfast commitment to designing beautiful, comfortable and fashionable seating products suitable for a wide variety of hospitality settings, Beaufurn proudly introduces the Moda Modular Lounge System. As we have seen by the popularity of previous collections including Eve, Camille, Zhuka and most recently Queue, our modular offerings are particularly appreciated for their ability to solve seating challenges while making a striking design statement.<br/>The scale of the Moda pieces and flexibility of configurations allows for limitless arrangements and rearrangements. Modules may be connected or form independent groupings. The three seating elements are an armless chair (29\u201d w x 27\u201d d x 29\u201d h), a corner unit (27\u201d w x 27\u201d d x 29\u201d h) and a backless chair (27.5\u201d w x 27.5\u201d d) which can also function as an ottoman. The seat height is 18\u201d and the 6\u201d solid wood legs have a black finish.<br/>Whether used in a lobby, hotel, airport, upscale restaurant, lounge, university or office setting, the stylish appeal of Moda\u2019s modern silhouette, along with the ability to use multiple inline or COM fabrics on these fully upholstered pieces, allows it to meet the creative design needs of any d\u00e9cor.",
