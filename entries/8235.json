"description_html": "The Light Guide Ring 9 Light LED Pendant uses an innovative system of redirected, glare-free, LED illumination. The light guide transmits light from a single LED source at its edge, evenly distributing the light over the face of the light guide through a precisely engineered pattern of light extraction points that provide an evenly lit, low-glare appearance, while maintaining the translucency of the optically clear acrylic disk. The location of the extraction points underwent a rigorous engineering process to ensure the balance of light output. \u201cFloating within an aluminum ring, an LED source edge-lights a light guide disk that redirects its luminance to its upper and lower surfaces, producing a glare-free radiance,\u201d says designer Robert Sonneman. <br/><br/>The Light Guide Ring LED Pendant is available in satin black or satin white exterior finishes and either apricot or satin white interiors. Robert Sonneman notes, \u201cApricot is a color that communicates light with a rich intensity. It is not necessarily my favorite color, but it is appropriate and vibrant to describe light especially in contrast with black, which is the absence of color. Apricot is associated with our identity, and we will continue to use it to identify our brand.\u201d <br/><br/>Modern in both appearance and technology, this unique piece provides energy efficient illumination as well as streamlined style for any space.",
