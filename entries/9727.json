"description_html": "The Powerful Cylinder is as interesting-looking as it is functional. When the top is closed, it leaves the user guessing and exploring its beauty; but press on the top of the table and the power access exposes itself in a fluid vertical motion. The Powerful Cylinder was designed to be used in public spaces and functional lounges where power access is now a necessity. It is constructed of figured, quarter-cut wood top, polished brass metal frame. Custom materials and finishes available. It measures 14\u201d long x 14\u201d wide x 20\u201d high<br/><br/>Working with one of the highest quality manufacturers and suppliers of power devices, we developed a line of powerful tables with thin-profile USB and outlets and achieved metal and colored faceplates matching the product,\" said acclaimed interior architect Lauren Rottet.<br/><br/>Integration has been taken to a whole new level and elegance with detailed incorporation of all that is needed for complex, yet simple to use power. \u00a0The piece is designed to change out the power if it goes obsolete and is durable enough to last for years -- the ultimate sustainable approach.",
