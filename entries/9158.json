"description_html": "Umbra is an unprecedented collection of LVT \u2014 a beautiful exploration of the intersection between analog methods and new technologies. <br/><br/>The design process for Umbra started with analog photographic techniques, capturing light and shadow. The result is an airy look in open spaces and a dramatic statement in intimate settings. <br/><br/>The collection is the industry\u2019s first LVT to offer a continuous, non-repeating pattern, made possible through Mannington\u2019s advanced manufacturing. With Umbra, no two tiles are alike: each monochromatic pattern is continuous and non-repeating \u2014 a breakthrough development for the industry. <br/><br/>The collection is available in three colorways: Umbra Eclipse, featuring deep, smoky blues and rich blacks; Umbra Dusk, a mid-gray tone that balances warm and cool; and Umbra Veil, with lighter tones that flow from pale blue to dove gray. The collection is available in eight tile and plank sizes, ranging from 3x36\u201d to 18x36\u201d. <br/><br/>This variety of formats makes for easy, customized installation while reducing waste and downtime during installation. With a total thickness of 2.5mm and a 1mm wear layer, Umbra is manufactured for durability. The product goes through 43 separate assurance checks across the manufacturing, finishing and postproduction processes to ensure exceptional quality. <br/><br/>Umbra features Mannington\u2019s patent-pending Quantum Guard(R) Elite multi-layered protection, engineered for best in class dimensional stability, advanced stain resistance, superior impact resistance, clean cutting during installation and with the highest scratch resistance in the industry.
