"description_html": "The Arcos collection is a minimalistic interpretation of Art Deco\u2019s geometric glamour. Though simple in form, Arcos maintains a strong visual presence with its cast aluminum armrests that form twin curves evoking the elegant rhythm of archways in the corridors and walkways throughout architecture of the famed era. The collection offers a balance between geometry and organic elements within a space. Arcos\u2019s signature armrests, turning into legs, gesture a strong geometric element, but at the same time the soft cushion adds an organic balance within any architectural setting. <br/><br/>Arcos is designed to be in dialogue with other Arper products such as Steeve Sofa, Parentesit Wall Panel and Cross Table to create cohesive and comfortable environments for rest, relaxation and socializing. Special care was dedicated to the color customizations with the possibility to create a monochrome of velvet-like, inky hues in both upholstery and matte lacquer metal that signals understated expression. <br/>Designed with public spaces in mind, the collection features a chair, lounge chair and a two-seat sofa, all with its signature armrests to accommodate an array of contract and residential settings from waiting rooms to lounge areas.",
