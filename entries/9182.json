"description_html": "Cover 1 and Cover 2, designed by Marie Christine Dorner for Ligne Roset, utilize an automated sewing robot to create intricate stitching and tufting patterns. The upholstery freely floats atop an all-foam base. Cover 1 is a modern take on a chesterfield. Cover 2 offers a \u2018lighter\u2019 version with a very different geometric, more contemporary design. Lines intersect effortlessly to create squares, diamonds, and stripes. Both are available in sofa and loveseat styles.",
