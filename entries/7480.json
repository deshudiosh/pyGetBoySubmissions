"description_html": "Mayer is pleased to introduce the Renewal Collection, designed by Kimberle Frost, featuring a new twist on recycled solution-dyed nylon performance fabrics. The collection reflects Frost\u2019s unique design aesthetic in combination with her talent for creating textural effects through the use of color and weave. All six patterns utilize the most innovative yarn technology and reflect a skillful approach to engineered constructions that are beautiful yet extremely durable, UV resistant, and bleach cleanable. The collection draws ideas from an archive of unique patterns and crafts them into new modern interpretations. The result is an integrated design and color story featuring six patterns: Lotus, an organic pattern layered with subtle weave effects; Rejuvenate, a modern leaf-and-vine embedded ottoman; Suna, referencing ornamental exploration with its vector like illustration; Sutra, a geometric grid of classic weaves that emerge as elements of faille, twill and crepe in a large-scale check; Vipassana, featuring a grand ornamental floral design with an ombre effect; and Zazen, an exquisite interpretation of a double ikat in a large yet useable scale. Perfect for almost all commercial environments including healthcare, senior living, corporate, hospitality, education, government and retail. The fabrics are woven with 100% recycled solution-dyed nylon and are milled in America. Prices range from $50.45 to $62.95 net.",
