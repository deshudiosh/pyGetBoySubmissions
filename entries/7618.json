This high performance collection includes six dynamic, bleach cleanable textile patterns; Vault, Windlass, Oculus, Lunette, Centring Stripe, and Mason Stripe, and one textured vinyl wallcovering; pattern Quarry. <br/><br/>In researching the physical processes and techniques utilized to construct these architecturally sound cathedrals, the Arc-Com Design Studio found them to be technically fascinating and creatively inspiring. The Foundation Collection visually reveals the patience, foresight, and physical strength of the human spirit to bring these projects to fruition, which in some cases spanned centuries and were fraught with setbacks before completion.<br/><br/>The Foundation Collection pays homage to craft and process. The textiles and vinyl wallcovering in the collection reveal a universal design language that ties each pattern together giving designers the ability to coordinate the collection beautifully and cohesively within a space. Though rooted in history, these innovative pattern interpretations come across as quite modern in both design and color selection and deliver a vast array of contemporary materials with a fresh perspective and a timeless feel.<br/><br/>The textile patterns in the Foundation Collection are a combination of solution dyed nylon and polyester and were tested to 100,000 double rubs on the Wyzenbeek. They are stocked with the INCASE stain protection, are bleach cleanable at a 20%/80% bleach to water ratio, and are manufactured in the USA. Pattern Quarry, is a Type II, 20 ounce Vinyl wallcovering on Recycled Polycotton. Produced with water based inks, pattern Quarry can contribute to Leed points and meets IAQ standards for California.",
