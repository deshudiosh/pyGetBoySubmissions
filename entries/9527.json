"description_html": "This t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate is sure to be the centerpiece of any room. The unique angular base of this all-original design sets off the angular form vocabulary seen throughout. But don't let the hard angles fool you, sitting inside is like floating on a cloud. Starting with a solid maple and walnut frame of 6/4 and 8/4 wood, it features mortise and tenon joinery throughout. The deck is 8-way hand tied coil springs with a hand stitched horse hair edge. Padding throughout is horse hair and cotton. The seat and back cushions are 50/50 down envelopes with high density fire rated foam cores. Shown with walnut base in hand rubbed oil finish.",
