"description_html": "Celebrating Louis Poulsen\u2019s philosophy of designing to shape light and inspired by the classic virtues of Danish design, Stine Gam and Enrico Fratesi, who make up the design duo GamFratesi, have designed a lamp dubbed Yuh.<br/><br/>One of the essential features of Yuh is that it is personal. The lamp is flexible and takes up very little space. The shade rotates, rises and drops, and pivots, illuminating and creating ambience in the required area. A lamp created just around you. Yuh includes a table lamp, floor lamp, and wall lamp, which are all available in white or black.",
