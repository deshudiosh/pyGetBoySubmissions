"description_html": "Timber is a fascinating material. Its organic beauty is apparent in its grain, colour and texture, with each piece unique in its characteristics. At Designer Doorware, we\u2019ve been using timber in a range of our entrance handles for years, its natural aesthetic creating a soft touch and giving a feeling of warmth to the entrance of any project. However, with a recent rise in the demands for architectural timber products from architects, we\u2019ve begun looking at further ways to bring this natural material into our products. <br/><br/>The Monte Timber lever collection was the culmination of 4 years of on-going research and development. The aim was to design a beautiful timber lever range that met the needs of the time. The desire to introduce warmth and comfort into our product range by utilizing the natural characteristics of timber. We were driven by the tactile aspects of the user experience. <br/><br/>This year, we would like to present our latest additions to the Monte Timber Collection:<br/><br/>Timber Zola lever <br/>Slimline and minimal, the perfect fusion of comfort and bold geometry.
