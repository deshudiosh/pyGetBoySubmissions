"description_html": "Drum Teen is a new version reduced in size for the acclaimed armchair designed by Mac Stopa for Cappellini introduced last year. Drum Teen is the newest addition to the collection, which already comprises the large Drum armchair, a modular table and modular pouf available in two different sizes. Stating a strong personality of its geometric lines, each piece in the collection can be used individually or combined in modular combinations of multiple shapes for various space configurations including in airports, building lobbies or in office spaces. Drum Teen adjusts to the functionality and size of the lounge space allowing to create semi-closed or open seating zones, which depending on need are separating or integrating the users. Among the several upholstery available in the collection, the rock-and-roll colors such as turquoise, orange, yellow, lime, red, white, black and brown are a perfect fit for the Drum Teen armchair. Made in Italy.",
