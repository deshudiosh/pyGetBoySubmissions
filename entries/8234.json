"description_html": "The Grand Raglan collection of sofas and lounge chairs is based on the Raglan family of modular<br/>sofas and lounge chairs, but is distinguished by its more generous and physical volume. Grand<br/>Raglan is the scene for a special moment. Its soft and elegant cushions extend generously in a<br/>corporeal design but adjusted in dimensions while the upholstered elements seem to float on its<br/>wooden base. Grand Raglan is a clear image of symmetry, and harmony of lines in a pure volume that<br/>fills the space and generates distinctive compositions in the places they occupy.<br/><br/>Grand Raglan is a very cozy lounge collection. It consists of lounge chair and 2- and 3-seater sofas<br/>with upholstered seat and back and base of steel base in chrome finish, white or black. Its design is<br/>broad and corporeal, very generous internally.<br/>Raglan offers premium comfort due to its seat and backrest with wide cushions thanks to an interior<br/>developed from the combination of foams that offer comfort and quick recovery.<br/>The harmonic style is the feature that brings lightness and innovation to Grand Raglan, it is the plinth<br/>that subtly elevates the piece and distinguishes it, which gives a feeling of suspension and elevation<br/>to its design.",
