"description_html": "Outline in solid surface material was launched in May 2017 as part of Isomi\u2019s first-ever collection of tables. Modular at the point of specification and installed as one finished piece, Outline can be specified at virtually unlimited lengths, making it suitable for use at any scale \u2013 whether in a meeting or conference room of any size, as a shared working space for multiple users, or as an individual workstation.<br/><br/>Outline combines a lightweight, fluid appearance with a durable, repairable, long-lasting finish. Once the table has been specified from a choice of modular parts, a meticulous focus on internal engineering allows for a seamlessly finished form with no visible joints. The table\u2019s inner workings include full cable management and the ability to be wired directly into the power source on installation, allowing users to plug their devices directly into the table. Fully DDA (Disability Discrimination Act)-compliant, the tables are specified at 600mm \u2013 or \u2018per-person\u2019 \u2013 increments. <br/><br/>\u201cThe beauty of working in solid surface is that is allows for fluid, seamless junctions that run right around the object \u2013 you can almost draw a continuous line around it \u2013 and the overall look becomes about the way the piece flows. This is made possible by the fact that all of the engineering is concealed within the table.\u201d Paul Crofts, designer.",
