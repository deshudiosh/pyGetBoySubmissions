"description_html": "In collaboration with Rich Brilliant Willing, Meyer Davis designed a new lighting collection including the two pieces: Hoist and Pilot, pendant and sconce collections that combine cutting-edge technology with casual sophistication. With a shared taste for simplicity and \u201cintelligent subtraction,\u201d the two studios developed timeless fixtures suited to a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments, uniquely solving common interior design problems. <br/>The Pilot chandelier is inspired by sculptural and modernist organic forms. Each branch of the Pilot chandelier features a rounded, shell-like shade. Sold as a kit of parts in a range of colors, lengths, and finishes, the compositions of these branches are sculptural exercise, allowing designers and architects to be playful. Configurations range from horizontal starburst ceiling fixtures to lengthy vertical staircase chandeliers. This transformative piece can be installed in spaces that vary dramatically. <br/>We developed tools for designers to create their own atmosphere. Thoughtfully considered and meticulously executed, the pieces elevate practical features like accent finishes and durable materials with a relaxed elegance, adding endless possibilities for installation.",
