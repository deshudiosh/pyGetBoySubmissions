This intention translates in a series of pieces that can be of<br/>flexible use, from coffee tables to planters to display system - yet affordable<br/>and customizable in different configurations..and finishes.<br/>The glass version is entirely made out of glass.<br/>The use of this material really expresses the product simplicity, while being<br/>very graphical in its context.<br/>These metal version features raw steel, with clear matte top coat. All the<br/>metal edges are hand polished, celebrating craft. One of the table tops is<br/>made out of carrara marble, with chamfered edges, in order to keep the<br/>same edge thickness of all the other elements.",
