"description_html": "Norma (design by Dan Yeffet)<br/>Norma photophore endorses a true return to the material\u2026 as well as a perfect adequacy between the DNA of the french brand and the emblematic work of Israeli designer Dan Yeffet. The piece is a monolith capped with a glass cylinder, which the undulating top part puts a delicate and mysterious veil on the scented candle. Just like a piedestal, the base in refined marble (Portoro, Saint Laurent, Paonazzo or Statuary marble) emphasizes the scented candle by giving it its height and nice presence, whilst the tinted glass cylinder (dark grey, bronze, blue or white colored glass) is a fragrance diffuser as well as a second skin. A majestic and perfectly balanced piece which both unveils and protects the candle\u2026 and allows to place it indoor and outdoor.",
