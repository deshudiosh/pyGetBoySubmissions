"description_html": "Luxe Surfaces's and Patty Madden Digital Wallcovering have created a product that takes walls to an entirely new level. Pairing our mylar substrate with the proprietary Zaza embossing of Patty Madden, together with delicious, visionary designs, Luxe Surfaces brings you wallcovering that takes 'art beyond the frame.' Our pairing of texture and subtle shimmer, with masked and ombred inks, results in three dimensional appeal that appears to morph when observed from various angles. This innovative media contributes depth, dimension and durability that intensifies image impact and makes walls an attractive focal point.<br/><br/>Patty's 'Nymph' pattern is the perfect compliment to this substrate. Patty has magically captured the inspiration namesake behind this lyrical design. Different from other goddesses, nymphs are regarded as divine spirits who animate nature. A dance of light upon the forest floor; an enchanting serenade. Nymph: absolutely bewitching.<br/><br/>Luxe Surfaces media have established, long-term histories of performance and durability and are approved and proven for commercial and residential environments. Nymph is pure metallurgy magic.",
