"description_html": "Devised as an evolution of the Volta lamp, the delicate suspended arches now become iconic circles that sketch out different ensembles in the air depending on the way they are arranged. Empty planes that are optionally filled with color when upholstered to become practical sound-absorbing panels.<br/>Customizable according to the layout of the circles, the Revolta lamp is equipped with adjustable-intensity LED technology. It features a tabletop version with the same circular body.",
