"description_html": "About Fractal\u2122<br/>Fractal allows anyone to design their own feature using a modular system and online design tool. <br/>Fractal\u2122 by Smith&amp;Fong applies the use of compositional geometric figures, each part of which has the same proportional character as the whole. Exciting and interpretive this expressive panel series uses the discipline of isosceles triangles to create squares and nested geometric shapes that express infinite space by emphasizing line, color and light. The visual complexity of the Fractal\u2122 compositions causes the eye to find forms beyond the geometry, evoking ideas and emotions.<br/><br/>Use the Fractool online design tool to configure your custom wall. https://design.plyboo.com/",
