The fourth Rockwell and Romanoff collaboration promises to be a timeless addition to classics Blanket\u2122 and Stitched\u2122.

Five graphic patterns and a solid coordinate are offered in tonal, metallic, and high-contrast colorways, and take the collection from chic to playful. The plush construction absorbs sound and creates a quiet atmosphere worthy of its name. The collection features 34 design combinations including solid companions.",
