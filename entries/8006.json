"description_html": "Level is one of the 4 Walls Ltd brands and the entire collection was launched into the market-place in June of 2017. You are only seeing 3 designs of the 24 designs released in the collection. The collection consists of \"Exclusive Designs\" that are Rights-Ready and fully customizable with Scale, Color and Substrate. We print the designs we create on a large variety of substrates, including but not limited to Type II Vinyl and Window Film. With nearly two decades of experience in custom digital wall coverings design and print, we have gone to great lengths to assure that our designs are highly researched and developed around market interests, current fashion, color trends as well as style trends. They are extraordinary. They are high resolution. And, they are ready to specify as-is or adapt to a any Specifier's needs. Within the 2017 Level Collection, we include content that was created with new techniques that we call \"WallFX\", which no other company in the world is doing in our industry. The \"String Theory\" showcases how we can utilize ink to print actual texture. It encompasses our exclusive \"Digital Embossing\" technique that clearly demonstrates the uniqueness of our collection and the uniqueness of our design capabilities. Clients have stated that the \"String Theory\" design gives them the sense that they are touching an actual Copper Patina. With our R&amp;D department hard at work, we expect many other new techniques that we'll launch to take our industry to a whole new \"Level\". (No pun intended)",
