"description_html": "The Bliss Collection for cc-tapis was designed by young Dutch designer Mae Engelgeer. The collection has been hand-knotted in Nepal by expert Tibetan artisans from Himalayan wool and pure silk. <br/><br/>Inspiration for this project came from a sample that Mae Engelgeer created where she was shaping round curves and trying to create a 3D effect. Keeping the playfulness of the Memphis movement in mind and experimenting with shape and color was the start of the BLISS collection. Using high quality materials like Himalayan wool with pure silk makes some parts literally glow. She refers to it as \u201cjewellery\u201d for your space.",
