"description_html": "Since 1988, MELLOW LIGHT by Zumtobel has been an icon in the world of office lighting. Now in its sixth generation, MELLOW LIGHT infinity offers a customized lighting solution with separately controllable light channels. The two lighting wings create a pleasant background brightness, while the center component can be adjusted for optimal task area lighting. This allows MELLOW LIGHT infinity to deliver three distributions: volumetric, directional (straight down only) and the combination of both. The center and side optics can be switched (or dimmed) separately \u2013 enabling simply task lighting, ambient lighting, or a combination of both.<br/><br/>MELLOW LIGHT achieves a Unified Glare Rating (UGR) &lt; 19, making it ideal for any application where visual comfort is a concern, including offices, classrooms and health care facilities. <br/><br/>Developed by Zumtobel in collaboration with Gensler, MELLOW LIGHT infinity offers a variety of options \u2013 including 1x4 and 2x2 sizes, recessed or surface mounted, two optic choices and multiple end cap finishes. The Crystal Optic is a reinterpretation of the classic lens optic, providing glare-free illumination with up to 4400 delivered lumens. The Lenticular Optic features prism louvers that create a gentle and homogeneous appearance while offering excellent glare suppression with up to 3400 delivered lumens. Surface mount end cap finishes include silver, white, bronze, black, or raw aluminum.",
