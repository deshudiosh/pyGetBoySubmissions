"description_html": "The Quorra contemporary light fixture by Feiss delivers a burst of energy as a completely modern interpretation of a traditional crystal chandelier, with a bit of Mid-Century modern inspiration. Sure to become the focal point of any room, the sculptural, asymmetric starburst silhouette of the Quorra chandelier boasts striated Clear Fluted glass pipes extending in all directions, with lengthy metal rods randomly interspersed between the glass piping, all of which are anchored to a hearty steel hub featuring a new Burnished Brass finish. The scale of this Feiss light fixture is as dramatic as its silhouette. Quorra is available in four sizes: a 12-light chandelier, a 14-light chandelier, a 16-light chandelier (which is depicted in the accompanying photos), and an amazing 41-light chandelier with a 48\u2019 diameter. Installed as a single statement fixture or in a grouping as a stunning art installation, the Quorra chandelier is ideal as dramatic foyer lighting, contemporary dining room lighting, modern bedroom lighting, as well as a wide array of cool commercial lighting like in upscale restaurants and boutique hotels. Damp Rated, the Quorra could also be used as bathroom lighting or as the crowning touch on a covered patio.",
