"description_html": "modularArts\u00ae AuralScapes\u2122 Magnetic Ceiling Tiles conveniently mount to standard metal T-grids. These 24\" tiles utilize typical ceiling grid assemblies as readily available and affordable structures to create \u201ccloud\u201d type configurations, or typical ceiling layouts. Unlike standard ceiling tiles, the patented attachment method connects from below the grid, concealing the t-grid and creating an uninterrupted field of texture.<br/><br/>AuralScapes\u2122 ceiling tiles are constructed of glass and gypsum, with a lightweight, class A, plant-based foam core. The visually stunning, patterned textures are designed to have sound enhancing qualities. The naturally sound-reflective characteristic of gypsum, combined with a very active multi-directional topography provides sound diffusion to the interior space. Sound diffusing surfaces scatter reflected sound and soften typical \u201cslap-back\u201d echo from hard surfaces, while still leaving a live sounding space.<br/><br/>Tiles are available with fixture pass-throughs for 6\u201d LED lighting, vents, etc. Custom pass-through voids are available. Additional safety lanyards on the backside of the tiles prevent falling should they be jarred or dislodged. Tiles are easily removed for access.",
