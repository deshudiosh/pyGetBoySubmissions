"description_html": "Named after famous artist Alexander Calder\u2019s renowned abstract mobile sculptures, the Modular seating unit designed by Studio Kairos consists of three moveable poufs and an aluminum tray. The set, which allows three or more units to be connected to one another in a multitude of formats thanks to specially designed fittings, enables its user to create seemingly endless combinations and a modern collaboration-oriented space. <br/><br/>As to the preference of its user, Calder is available with power sockets for added convenience. Thanks to its rotatable inner casing, the socket set ensures that the sockets become disguised when not in use. Calder\u2019s socket set includes 2 child-proof power sockets, 1 USB output, 1 HDMI output and 1 CAT5 Ethernet port. These electric connections are included into the design as a plain detail by virtue of zippers used on the pouf surface.",
