"description_html": "Inspired by Heraldry symbols dating as far back as Antiquity, international award winning designer Tina Nicole was developed the Korz chair out of her love of the symbolism and beauty of Heraldic designs. Heraldry has been described poetically as \"the shorthand of history\" where symbols tell the story of a family or tribe\u2019s rank, pedigree and military achievements. In modern times, Heraldry is used by individuals, public and private organizations, corporations, cities, towns, and regions to symbolize their heritage, achievements, and aspirations. The V shape at the back in Heraldic nomenclature symbolizes strength and fortitude making this design all the more desirable for the interior. Several leathers, designer fabrics and steel finishes are available.",
