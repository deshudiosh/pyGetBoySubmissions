"description_html": "With the rise of nimble collaborative spaces, the multi office Gensler team partnered with Halcon to co-create a product featuring the ultimate flexibility in configuration, finish, and project application. Obvious and informal, but with a scale and nuance in detailing that transcends casual. The collection is comprised of three components, a bench and credenza complimenting the Halo table. The suite was designed to provide a fully complimentary line without an overmatched aesthetic.<br/> The table design incorporates a groundbreaking edge profile that provides table and chair protection along with integrated connectivity to streamline design. The table surface is equally protected, remaining pure in form with power and data integrated cleanly into the Halo edge instead of weeded into the surface. The Halo edge is a cast polyurethane section ringing the under edge of the table. Halo tables are available in a wide variety of shapes and colors to compliment any scheme, leg, or table top material specified.<br/> The bench design provides a modular solution to gallery seating that fully integrates with the credenza. This bench is perfectly able to accommodate large groups in small rooms and for casual meetings. The design incorporates an optional back and comes in a range of sizes and two seating heights. The credenza design responds to the growing need for flexible and casual storage solutions, especially in less formal lounges and conference spaces. The Halo sideboard includes options for glassware, waste bins, refrigeration, entertainment, cutlery and cleanup.",
