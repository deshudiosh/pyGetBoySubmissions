"description_html": "Architects turn to AF |New York when a difficult assignment requires professionals to collaborate and execute their design needs. Our area of expertise has allowed this project with Herzog &amp; du Meuron designed for the Ian Schrager Group come to life. <br/><br/>These custom washbasins where created with HDM's designs in mind. The washbasins were created in custom shapes to fit each space in colors that are one of a kind to the hotel. The execution of the details in these designs is combined with the quality and ability to make this work an added value of AF | New York's design.",
