"description_html": "Luminous hues and brilliant patterns deliver all the mystery and beauty of deep space exploration in this cosmos-inspired Robert Allen Contract collection. Rigorously texted to meet or exceed industry standards, and with a stain repellent finish on all upholstery fabrics, including velvet, this performance line pushes the boundaries for durability and ingenuity. <br/><br/>Capturing the intergalactic drama of supernovas, sonic booms and cosmic dust clouds, high-contrast dark and lustrous light hues in fine jacquard constructions create striking fabrics for drapery use.<br/> <br/>From brilliant meteor showers to dimpled lunarscapes, fading eclipses to laser-thin light beams, our upholstery designs rely on a variety of scales, textures and finishes to achieve an otherworldly effect.",
