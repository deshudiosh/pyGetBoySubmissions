"description_html": "An inspired extension of our Boulders HPL set. The rainbow-hued shapes seen here, mimicking the spectacular rock formations seen in Arizona\u2019s surreal Painted Desert and Petrified Forest regions, is joined by several snazzy dinosaurs in equally outrageous day-glo splendor. These dinosaurs offer great potential for play, their fearsome size and stature transformed into the cuteness of a colorful indoor pet with openings for safe crawl space. Combined with the quasi-rock formations and free-flowing shapes of the floor design, these prehistoric critters complete an imaginative re-drawing of an ancient epoch through a child\u2019s eyes. <br/>For indoor and outdoor use. <br/><br/>Where applicable, suitable fall zone and impact attenuation surface will be required subject to certifier's recommendation.",
