"description_html": "These meticulously hand-knotted rugs include eight primary designs and four variations, which explore alternative colours, fibers, and textures, for a total of twelve options. This all-new edition subtly appropriates the language of black-and-white image-making to craft a meditation on modern serenity. While its mood may be contemplative, Blur\u2019s conception is an audacious challenge to the frequently tradition-bound world of hand-woven carpets. Blending the timeless poetry of Nepalese craftsmanship, the richness of materials like Tibetan wool, Chinese silk, Himalayan cashmere, and South African mohair, and effects inspired by vintage monochromatic photos, each of Blur\u2019s twelve pieces reveals an affinity between its generations-old handknotting techniques and the manual artistry of early photographers. The resulting collection paradoxically transcends its roots to put forward a stylized aesthetic of ultramodern sophistication. In designs such as Exposure and Bokeh, Blur employs photographic techniques such as the high-contrast urban lighting of film noir to reimagine the relationship between light and shadow, rendering each as a series of spectral figures confined within cropped frames. In a similar vein, designs like Aperture, Density, and Saturation pay tribute to the primitive cameras and experimental darkroom techniques of early 20th century photographers, such as Man Ray and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy.",
