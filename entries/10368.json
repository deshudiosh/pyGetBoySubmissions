"description_html": "\u200bTANAMI is a striking new addition to BDI\u2019s growing credenza category, designed by Matthew Weatherly. Inspired by the Tanami desert, this credenza features three-dimensional dune-like waves across the door fascia and side panels, creating depth and texture. These flowing, sculpted patterns contrast with the credenza's straight lines, resulting a stunning console that is sure to be the focal point of any room. <br/><br/>The carved and textured doors conceal four compartments inside, each with an adjustable shelf for storage of various essentials, whether for the dining room, entryway, bedroom or entertainment room. Wire management holes in the back of the cabinet as well as integrated ventilation make it suitable for light media use.<br/><br/>Measuring 32\" H x 84\" W x 18\" D, the Tanami can display a TV up to 85\" if used as a media cabinet, and can also store up to 12 components. However used, Tanami boasts a stunning Satin White finish that makes it as beautiful as it is functional.",
