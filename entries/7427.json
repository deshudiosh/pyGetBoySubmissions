"description_html": "The Hay\u00f3n x Nani is a dreamy, wild collection with a great sense of humor. Created with the hand tufting technique, a manually operated pistol injects pieces of wool, intuitive and fluid lines are achieved, as well as an organic composition. The definitive and faithful reproduction of the original sketch by the designer.<br/><br/>A first glance reveals a chaotic tangle of colours and shapes that invade the rug. However, after looking carefully, the imagination of Jaime Hay\u00f3n springs to life: turtles, lips, hands, stools, fish, half men \u2013 half birds\u2026<br/><br/>The elements have been distributed in such a manner that the rug can be observed from different angles. The collection comprises two models and four sizes. The square model has been specially designed to hang on a wall as a tapestry.",
