"description_html": "Soulbox is a unique piece with a chameleonic format, both in appearance and functionality. It is an altar, a vitrine, a display case, a source of light, an object with its own personality, its appearance transforming with the light that is reflected on its surface.<br/>Soulbox is the treasure chest where we save relics, objects for a collection or with a specific emotional value; a place to display intimate pieces. It can also be the vitrine where objects of daily use can be organized: the wine glasses and bottles in the dining room, a selection of books in the office, or cosmetic products in a bathroom. <br/>Soulbox does not need a material content to justify its raison d'etre. It can be empty and still fill the room with the color of its materials, the reflections and the light it shines. <br/>Soulbox has a simple and functional design. The visual effect of the acrylic glass plates of different colors is highlighted by the installation of LED strips in its back, and by the use of iridescent vinyl.<br/><br/>SOULBOX has been exhibited in Zona MACO Art Fair, CDMX, Mexico (February 2017) and in Producto Fresco \u2013 Fresh Product, Madrid, Spain (June 2017).",
