"description_html": "The parasol light.<br/><br/>Designed by Yonoh, the Banga pendant exemplifies the Valencia-based creative design studio\u2019s quest to bring an understandability and functionality, a freshness and uniqueness, to its creations. Available in two sizes, Banga is crafted using a series of individual sheets of veneer, each one connected via a lustrous metallic strip.<br/><br/>The Banga light\u2019s combined veneer pieces and metal frame bear a resemblance to a plush brolly or indeed, to a well dressed parasol. Banga enjoys an expressive Eastern world-like quality, together with a nod to neoclassicism and its principles of simplicity and symmetry.",
