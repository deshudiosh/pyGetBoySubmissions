"description_html": "A new brand of lighting, launched on January 18th, 2017, Vermont Modern by Hubbardton Forge is an irreverent, contemporary lighting line with stylish, inspired designs. It\u2019s focused on simple, clean lines, and opaque finishes. With six bold colors and sleek shapes, Vermont Modern is perfect for urban spaces (or any space looking for a modern piece that pops). There\u2019s often a sense of movement, a kinetic element or something inherent to the design that demands attention. Every piece is made in Castleton, Vermont by artisans using environmentally responsible manufacturing techniques including non-VOC powder coats, a phosphate-free bioremediation cleaner for wash solutions and recycled and recyclable materials. Designers and makers, engineers and production, and the entire staff are all under one roof.<br/><br/>From brand exploration through development, to logos, fonts and color palette, Vermont Modern was entirely brought to life by our in-house Art Directors. All print ads, collateral materials and graphics were conceived and executed on-site. A new website was designed in-house, as well as the design and execution of a full digital ad campaign, and eMail marketing efforts. Social media campaigns were waged across Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Houzz, and Vimeo. Blogs, on vermontmodern.com, and guest-featured VM-blog pop-ups on other sites, helped to get the word out for this exciting, new brand.<br/><br/>And, who can resist a pink deer?",
