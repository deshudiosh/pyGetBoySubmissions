"description_html": "Preferring a choice that goes against the grain in relation to the company\u2019s classical aesthetics while nevertheless remaining delicate and casual, the design of the new Chignon chair by LucidiPevere offers a balance between softness and lightness with a veiled retro touch. The entirely curved wood structure is designed to envelope and enclose the sinuosity of the chair, acting as a support for the comfortable and voluminous seat and the soft, fun seatback. These elements are brought together by two beechwood curls \u2013 GTV\u2019s formal stylistic trait par excellence \u2013 resembling a kind of coiffure. The result is intentionally feminine in form. It is not delicate and slender but shapely and voluptuous, with an intensely iconic presence that makes it perfect for defining any domestic space, and also for creating a relaxing atmosphere in a work environment.",
