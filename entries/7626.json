"description_html": "We are pleased to debut the latest addition to our growing collection of outdoor furniture, the Amalfi chair by our friend and frequent collaborator, Patrick Naggar. Handmade in our studio in Manhattan, each piece in the now 3-piece collection begins as a sculpture in clay, then cast for a mold. A true work of sculpture, it is art to interact with.The foundry finish imparts a rich depth of color that begs you to come closer.The resin is offered in a range of 5 colors, and perhaps best of all, the collection is entirely suited for outdoor use, though equally striking indoors.",
