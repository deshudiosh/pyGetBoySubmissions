"description_html": "Every step forward is a shift between what was and what is yet to be. Inspired by the beauty of change, and how the roles of technology and design shape our lives, Milliken\u2019s Shift collection brings dynamic and modern movement to the floor with the resiliency of luxury vinyl tile.<br/><br/>Four tech-inspired colorways explore variations of nuanced gray for stimulating contemporary visuals. Various possible layouts, such as herringbone, half drop, brick ashlar, random, and monolithic patterns, allow designers to enhance depth in interiors. Shifting lines in a subtle gradation of neutrals create an undulating ebb and flow when installed monolithically, while plank installations provide dramatic and active contrast. <br/><br/>A sustainable approach to LVT, Shift is FloorScore\u00ae certified for indoor air quality and is 100% phthalate free. The collection also carries an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and Declare label for material transparency. <br/><br/>Available in 18\u201d x 36\u201d plank luxury vinyl tiles with a sleek micro-beveled edge for elegance.",
