"description_html": "The Edition table in concrete was launched in May 2017 as part of Isomi\u2019s first-ever collection of tables. Modular at the point of specification and installed as one finished piece, Edition can be specified at virtually unlimited lengths, making it suitable for use at any scale \u2013 whether in a meeting or conference room of any size, as a shared working space for multiple users, or as an individual workstation.<br/><br/>The Edition table represents a continuation of Isomi\u2019s acclaimed work in concrete. Cast in authentic, lightweight, stain-resistant concrete, the table offers a highly considered aesthetic that is rooted in design director Paul Crofts\u2019s enduring interest in b\u00e9ton brut \u2013 the smooth concrete surface popularised by the brutalist architecture of the 1960s and 70s. The table\u2019s robust legs are a continuous component of the overall piece, seamlessly integrated with a finely proportioned top. A shadow gap at the base of the table lends a sense of lightness and refinement, which is reflected in the premium quality of the material. Integrated cable management includes reversible cable trays finished in concrete and hot rolled steel.<br/><br/>\u201cThe fascinating challenge in creating these tables was to combine the raw, brutalist, slab-like forms associated with concrete with a highly refined and detailed finished product. With all of the elements cast in at source, the tables are moulded, finished and assembled without any superfluous intervention, creating pieces that are visually simple yet highly functional.\u201d Paul Crofts, designer.",
