"description_html": "A collision of colors, textures, and surfaces gives rise to the Era &amp; Karim Rashid furniture collection. Consisting of a sofa, table, and desk, the collection is a collaboration of essential design, sustainability, and expert craftsmanship that truly embodies Design for Everyone.<br/><br/>The plush Krate sofa is comprised of soft edged-planes converging into a minimal and sophisticated interplay of upholstery and wood. Eschewing with all but the most necessary details, Krate is simple but definitely not basic.<br/><br/>Kolor desk intelligently adds vibrancy to any environment. The clean, streamlined desk design gets a playful pop of color from its row of multi-color drawers, bestowing it with a lyrical quality while also providing an orderly visual system of organization.<br/><br/>Embodying balance and luxury, the Kollide table gets its name from 3 flat wooden (lacquered and natural) boards colliding and creating a base for a glass top. The repeated, intersecting ovoid shapes harmonize separate elements into an irresistible whole.<br/><br/>Another feature of the collection\u2019s timeless design is its commitment to sustainability. Wood used in production is derived from raw materials from Croatian forests guaranteeing responsible management and adherence to strict environmental regulations. During the final processing vegetable oil is used instead of toxic paints or varnishes, preserving the natural state of the wood and eliminating harmful evaporation into the area. The result is progressive design that \u201clasts as long as an era.\"",
