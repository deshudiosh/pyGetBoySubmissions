"description_html": "The Japanese tradition of weaving ultra-thin Paulownia wood onto a flexible paper backing has been modernized to incorporate die-cutting for more versatile design options. Grand Scale Ajiro Coffers is hand-inlaid wood veneer set in a parquet frame. Grand Scale is more than doubled in size from the original to accentuate larger landscapes and soaring ceilings. Cost effective and environmentally sound, this renewable resource is beautifully stained in 15 hues and hand-finished in our Chicago studio. Ajiro wood veneer wall coverings are an attractive alternative to<br/>costly solid wood paneling.",
