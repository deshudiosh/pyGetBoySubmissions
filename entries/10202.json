This rug's rich, complex and painterly veining is drawn directly from a slab of marble. The stately, solid character of Calacatta or Arabescato marble rendered in wool and silk. <br/><br/>Hand-tufted with fine, long fiber, New Zealand wool and dull silk. Pile height at wool is 1/2\" and pile height at silk is 5/8\" and 120 knots per square inch.",
