"description_html": "Suspenders Precise is a modular LED system of components that adds lighting functionality and performance to the decorative Suspenders system. Suspended from Hangers or fixed flush to a Power Bar, Precise components provide up, down, and amiable directional light sources in spot and flood options, as well as direct and reflected ambient light sources. Built on a precisely-engineered modular system, Suspenders components screw, twist and snap-lock in place, forming unified interlocking assemblies that enhance the range of possibilities, applications and configurations of the expanding Suspenders system. <br/><br/>This lighting system is truly technology-enabled design. The system was achievable only with the efficacy of LED electronics, using efficient potential to minimize scale and achieve functional clarity. The vision of a suspended illuminating network that you can configure as long, as wide and as deep as you can imagine was only possible using electronic components, replacing the heavy electrical system components of the past. Using electronic transformers, LED luminaires, and some very sophisticated electronic circuitry resulted in a system of limitless potential and expandability.<br/><br/>The Suspenders Precise System offers infinite configuration potential thanks to the numerous components that can be customized based on preference. Power Bar Hangers are available in three styles: parallel, perpendicular, and rotational; and four lengths: 6\u201d, 9\u201d, 12\u201d and 18\u201d. Aluminum Light Bars are available in three sizes: 12\u201d, 24\u201d, and 36\u201d. Luminaire are available in multiple styles, including Single Luminaires, Cluster Luminaires, Precise Cylinder Luminaires, Precise Light Bars, Ladder Lights, and Monoline Pendants. All Luminaires have a warm white color temperature (3000K) and are a minimum of 90 CRI.",
