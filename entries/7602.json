"description_html": "USAI Lighting has developed USAI Connect, a LED downlight that seamlessly integrates into existing ceiling systems to create perfect architectural alignment and lighting consistency. Whereas traditional downlight installations in regular and vector tiles require customized cut-outs for lighting fixtures, USAI Connect enables designers to get clean, pre-cut, factory-finished panels and suspension system components with LED downlights never before possible at the on-center ceiling grid intersection. Architects and designers can choose from a variety of popular ceiling panels and suspension systems available at Armstrong Ceilings and also select from several pre-existing lighting options from USAI Lighting, including True Zero Connect and SliverLED Connect, to use in conjunction with the USAI Connect system. With over 1,200 delivered lumens from its minimal 3-3/8\" aperture and 1\" regress, USAI Connect can be installed at maximum ceiling height and still provide full lumen count and beam spread. This latest lighting solution adds to USAI\u2019s growing and innovative family of award-winning BeveLED products.",
