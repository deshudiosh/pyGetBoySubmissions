"description_html": "During his creative process for Filo, designer Andrea Anastasio became inspired by the idea of deconstructing the traditional lamp form. By separating individual pieces that comprise it - the light source, the base, decoration elements and electrical wiring \u2013 Anastasio brought out each part\u2019s own structural and aesthetic characteristics. Filo\u2019s essential character is the result of playing with the fundamentals of decorative objects, elevating elements that are not traditionally considered decorative, alongside the adornments.<br/><br/>The colorful electrical wire is wrapped in fabric. Varying shapes of Murano glass spheres contrast with the minimal ceramic diffuser in a rhythmic dialog. These elements give Filo the resemblance to a delicate necklace with colorful glass beads.<br/><br/>The lamp comes in eight color combinations, from light watercolor tones to transparent hues of Murano glass, to bright, bold accents of the fluorescent cord, each with distinct personalities. The diversity of options makes it possible for Filo to work in a variety of residential and contract settings. Users also have the ability to string Filo\u2019s wire in whichever way they desire.",
