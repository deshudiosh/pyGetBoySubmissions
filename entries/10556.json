"description_html": "In her third collection for the Mexican cement tile manufacturer Original Mission Tile, Laura Gottwald presents another Op Art tile (1969), two very distinct foliate designs, (Kaua'i and Myrtle) and two new geometrics - a purist color wheel (Color Theory) and a Maasai-inspired ring motif (Nomad). The Collection makes use of Original Mission's extraordinary color palette and enriches and expands possibilities for using cement in strikingly graphic, original modernist motifs and patterns.<br/><br/>Laura\u2019s graphic eye and refined sensibility are cultivated over decades of service as a interior designer in private-practice. She works with clients to create balanced, livable, inviting, comfortable, intriguing and harmonious spaces. As a designer\u2019s designer whose clients include many architects, fashion designers, gallerists, artists, and musicians, she infuses highly functional interiors with wit, charm, and eclecticism based on the client's own affinities and inclinations.",
