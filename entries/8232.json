"description_html": "NOTE reimagines the traditional club chair with careful attention to geometry and form. Precisely finished edges and exact seams determine the shape. NOTE is perfectly finished with contrast stitching adding an element of interest from every angle. Its lines are graceful and sinuous. Note\u2019s most distinctive feature is its geometrically faceted sides, with its softly cambered seat and gently curved armrests. The generously scaled seat, back support, and wraparound arms achieve maximum comfort while occupying a surprisingly minimal footprint. NOTE embraces you and offers an inviting place to sit and relax. This design is exceptional in lobbies, corporate lounges, libraries, or any environment. It enhances any modern setting, whether public spaces, residential or hospitality.",
