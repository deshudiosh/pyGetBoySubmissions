"description_html": "Fluid and dynamic \u2013 Patricia Urquiola, once again explores the mutability of light in the Liquefy table collection for Glas Italia. Invoking the ephemeral beauty and lustrous iridescence of oil in water, these tables are available in three sizes, and two rich, yet subtle, hues: green and pink. <br/><br/>Crafted from tempered extra light glass and with faded, irregular decoration, Liquefy takes on the color and veins of marble. Enclosed by a coordinated color frame, the decoration is painted on the glass perimeter. Also available in pink hues.",
