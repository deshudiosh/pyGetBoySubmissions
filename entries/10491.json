"description_html": "Designer Kim Tyler\u2019s Chas Chair has turned the slipper chair into a sculptural and inspirational nod to mid-century design, with felted knitted wool fabric, that beckons one to stay seated and bask in the softness of natural fiber.<br/><br/>The colors of the fabric are bold and hot in hues; the design organic and fluid. The solid maple frame effortlessly suspends the upholstered seat; the back of the chair, an abstracted human form. The craftsmanship of Bespoke by Luigi Gentile brought forth the vision of Kim Tyler\u2019s design.<br/><br/>The designer, the manufacturer, and textile mill are all located in the tri-state area supporting the Made in America movement. The chair can be made in other solid woods and adaptable in COM/COL creating different moods while never loosing the essence of the sculptural design or it\u2019s inherent whimsy. <br/><br/>Dimensions: 24\u201dw x 28\u201dd x 32\u201dh; seat height 17\u201d.",
