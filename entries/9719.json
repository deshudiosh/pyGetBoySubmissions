"description_html": "The Wood Float Chair features a solid mahogany wood frame with an acrylic back and an upholstered seat cushion optional. With a floating back plane and seat plane, this chair frames its environment and allows higher visibility in a space. It measures 26\"L X 28\"W X 29\"H; SH 15.25\". There is also a Wood Float Sofa. <br/><br/>\"Using my understanding of the manufacturing process in metals, woods, glass and acrylic, I was able to fully detail the product for ease of construction and durability. Many of the commercial manufacturers will not work in acrylic and most who are familiar with acrylic do not know how to work in metals and wood to the high-end degree required by this product. I introduced the best manufacturers of each of the materials and helped them work through any concerns or issues. They now know not to be afraid of acrylic and how amazing it can be.<br/><br/>I have used acrylic for many years and can speak to its durability and strength. It is also innovative in the way it allows customization and fits into smaller spaces as well as a multitude of stylistic environments,\" said acclaimed interior architect Lauren Rottet.<br/><br/>No endangered wood species are used in the collection and there are no infill materials, such as substrates. All the finishes are integral with the composition of the product.",
