"description_html": "New Ravenna is pleased to introduce Jardins Fran\u00e7ais, a collection of five mosaics designed by Caroline Beaupere. The mosaics are handcrafted in Virginia from combinations of natural stone, brass, aluminum, glass, and shell. The Jardins Fran\u00e7ais collection was inspired by the formal gardens of France, from their ornate ironwork to their intricate symmetry. The variety of materials represent the four seasons, and the subtle shifts of Mediterranean light. Winter is represented by a brisk tonal white and grey in Jardin de Villandry; Spring is enlivened by luminescent shell used in Fleur de Lys; vivid summer light glows in a Monet blue glass in Jardin de Giverny; and it is the brass in Jardin de Versailles that emulates the golden hues of Fall.<br/><br/>Caroline Beaupere, a New York and Connecticut based interior designer says of Jardins Fran\u00e7ais, \"I grew up in Provence and spent my childhood visiting Morocco, Spain, and Italy. I was greatly inspired by Gaudi\u2019s work in Barcelona. The theme of this mosaic collection comes from my favorite gardens in France. I've replicated pathways leading to fountains and iron grill work using the unlimited creativity of mosaic available at New Ravenna.\"<br/><br/>Each pattern can be fully customized with the client\u2019s material preferences to fit the scope of any commercial or residential project. Every mosaic in the Jardins Fran\u00e7ais collection can be installed indoors or out, on floors or walls.",
