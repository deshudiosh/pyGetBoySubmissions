"description_html": "Surround\u2122 is a collection of healthcare furnishings designed to support family members in healthcare environments. With the flexibility to serve as a sleep surface or sofa and features to support eating, working and socialization, the Surround\u2122 Collection offers family members a designated space in a patient room to support the care of their loved one, relax in comfort and communicate effectively with clinicians. <br/><br/>Research shows that family involvement in care can influence patient satisfaction and outcomes and improve the experiences of patients, family members and healthcare providers. Recent insights and observations from Steelcase Health indicate that patient rooms often do not adequately meet the needs of family members and are not designed to help them navigate the multiple roles they play while supporting a loved one who is hospitalized. In many current patient room settings, family members are often faced with challenges related to communication, sleeping, sharing meals, hosting visitors, storage and overcrowding, and maintaining daily routines such as paying bills and working.<br/><br/>Steelcase Health created the Surround\u2122 Collection to better support family members and their ability to be involved in a patient\u2019s care.",
