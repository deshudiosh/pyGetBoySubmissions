"description_html": "The inspiration behind Calia was the heritage of the Gunlocke brand itself. The goal was to merge frame and upholstery into a singular form that simultaneously speaks to the brand\u2019s more than century old history of wood craftsmanship and the brand\u2019s continuing evolution. As a visual cue, the angle of the back legs is purposely severe to suggest a dynamic movement and shift of the brand. While the back of the frame utilizes the old-world technology of steam bending, emphasizing beautiful grain detailing and adding strength to the overall construction.",
