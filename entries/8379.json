"description_html": "Vico Magistretti designed a light in 1977 called Lyndon with the idea of a structure holding a simple ball of light. The minimal approach to its support is contrasted with the delicate glass bowl with the idea of it reading like a cloud. To commentate the tenth year of his death, we selected the Lyndon light to pay homage and created a light with the same spirit in mind. <br/><br/>In our everyday existence, light serves us by enhancing everything around it, while it itself is often neglected. Here, the inspiration comes from the quintessential source of light; like its ancient predecessor, the fiery torch, this design consists simply of an upright rod with an illuminated tip. Celebrating the glorious spectacle of light itself, the tinted glass shade is a modest attachment that branches off the main support to gently shield its centerpiece.",
