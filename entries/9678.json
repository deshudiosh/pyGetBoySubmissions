"description_html": "This year, HOLLY HUNT introduced Moray, a new 25-piece collection of outdoor furniture inspired by the elegant and fluid motion of the sea. In designing the collection, the studio created a series of pieces that have the sophistication of indoor furniture translated for outdoor use.<br/> <br/>The marketing campaign to launch Moray featured a series of images from The Kampong, a National Tropical Botanical Garden located on Biscayne Bay in Coconut Grove, Florida. The Kampong is the former estate of Dr. David Fairchild, the famed botanical explorer who traveled throughout Southeast Asia and other tropical regions collecting exotic plants he introduced to the U.S. The Moray Collection paired well with the fascinating array of tropical fruit cultivars, flowering trees, and wildlife found within The Kampong.<br/> <br/>The campaign included advertising, digital marketing, social media, and a 40-page printed catalog and brochure. The 9\" x 11.25\" catalog was UV printed on Neenah's Solar White Classic Crest, allowing the reader to experience the beauty of Moray and The Kampong.<br/> <br/>Photographer: Paul Warchol<br/>Image Direction: Rick Valicenti",
