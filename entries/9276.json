"description_html": "Paola Lenti's fearless flair and masterful use of color reaches a new level in the Spezie outdoor pouf. The removable cover is crafted from Lenti's signature Kimia fabric, a simple base cloth that serves equally well as an outdoor rug, or as upholstery for a wealth of shapes and polystyrene spheres. <br/><br/>Each pouf is then hand-embroidered with flat rope braids in an illimitable array of both colors and patterns, offering a level of customizable embellishment that is simply unmatched in the outdoor sphere. Available in two sizes and with/without backrest, Spezie is equally suited for indoors.<br/><br/>16\u201d x 16\u201dh x 16\u201d<br/>39\u201d x 13\u201dh cx 39\u201d <br/>backrest: 28\u201d x 12\u201dh x 12\u201d",
