"description_html": "Vinea \u2013 which is Latin for vine- was designed by Pedro Bodegas Jr. of Grupo Eco, manufactured by Littman Brands Contract Lighting and developed in collaboration with Troy Custom Design Studio for the new Sofitel M\u00e9xico Reforma hotel in Mexico City. Inspired by the geometric patterns and contemporary architecture of the hotel, Vinea is built around a linear LED featuring four downlights. Around this luminous center, 720 aluminum links hang from each other, creating flexible strands that drape down and curve slightly inwards. These rippling metal \u201cvines\u201d sparkle with movement, reflecting Vinea\u2019s inner glow. Its tiny pieces require extremely precise parametric design and CAM manufacturing, yet Vinea has an unmistakable organic quality to it.",
