Haworth Collection GAN Mangas Original is an exclusive offering of Patricia Urquiolas designs and colorways.<br/><br/>The revolution in the world of rugs is called Mangas, designed by Patricia Urquiola.

Mangas Original rugs are crafted from 100% wool in organic shapes and innovative color combinations that bring softness and warmth to any space. <br/><br/>Available either in a rectangle or in the whimsical Globo shape, Mangas Originals add visual and tactile interest wherever they are used. The rugs ground furniture in large open areas and social spaces.",
