"description_html": "Internationally acclaimed textile designer Stacy Garcia drew inspiration for her latest collection of Sunbrella\u00ae Contract fabrics from the historic Spanish city of Seville, the capital of southern Spain\u2019s Andalusia region and birthplace of flamenco. The Seville Collection embraces the locale\u2019s natural landscape, architecture and vibrancy.<br/><br/>To support the launch of the Seville collection, Sunbrella Contract created a direct mail brochure featuring elements of both the fabric collection and architectural features native to the Spanish city. The brochure illustrates the Stacy Garcia story, from her inspiration to fabric designs, colorways and attributes. Through unique, watercolor illustrations and textured paper, the result was a striking piece that people could touch and interact with. <br/><br/>A swatch card inside the tri-fold brochure featured small swatches of the nine charming performance fabrics designed with both indoor and outdoor commercial environments in mind. The Seville collection contains a well-edited mix of small, medium and large-scale multicolor patterns, which were highlighted through the swatch imagery. The brochure also emphasized Sunbrella Contract features such as exceptional UV performance and ultimate cleanability. Each mailer was enclosed inside a clear covering, which included the brochure and an assortment of three fabric swatches from the Seville collection.",
