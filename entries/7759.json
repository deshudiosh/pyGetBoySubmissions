"description_html": "As a floor tile series designed to interact with space and time, the new Mosa \u03bc series cleverly responds to a setting\u2019s changing light. The surface subtly shifts shades during the course of the day. The series is inspired by the extraordinary relationship between illumination and the color spectrum. Working with ceramic pigments and the way they blend, Mosa\u2019s specialists created tiles that absorb certain colors and reflect others, playing with light waves and the different tones they produce. Each surface in the Mosa \u03bc series is a combination of many different colors; an optical blend of millions of brightly tinted grains made by mixing ceramic pigment with clay. The range\u2019s distinctive look is the product of a bespoke arrangement of different bright hues, transformed by the way they are lit.<br/><br/>The series includes tiles in one size \u2013 60 x 60 centimeters - and four key overall shades - white, light grey, grey and brown. As well as taking their cue from illumination, these pieces are also affected by distance and angle \u2013 including the shape of a room and the size of each ceramic area. Nearby objects and materials also play a key role in the appearance of a Mosa \u03bc surface, as the tiles are designed to pick up on other colors within the same space.",
