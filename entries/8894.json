"description_html": "Eskayel, a Brooklyn-based textile company introduces its latest offering, the Beautiful Decay Mural Collection. The collection will include five murals that were originally painted with water-colors and then enlarged as part of a wall installation for a custom project in collaboration with the design firm The New Design Project.<br/>Drawing inspiration from the patinated textures of weathered buildings, Eskayel\u2019s watercolor murals feature tonal abstract motifs reflective of a modern sensibility. Sweeping curves contrast with imperfect lines, while shadowy brushstrokes punctuate the canvas, resulting in a fluidity that mirrors the peeling exteriors of building surfaces in remote towns of Morocco, Croatia, and Italy.<br/>\u201cThrough my travels, I\u2019ve always been captivated by weathered buildings as different patterns and shading emerge from the layers of paint peeling off the exteriors,\u201d stated Founder and Creative Director Shanan Campanaro. \u201cWith this being my first ever mural project, I wanted to be able to share what I\u2019ve created for The New Design Project with my customers.\u201d<br/>Available fabric grounds include oyster linen, organic denim and a 50/50 linen cotton blend. Wallpaper will be available in non-woven vellum, which has a light textured print surface in a matte finish. Standard materials are suitable for residential and low-traffic commercial locations. Type II Commercial grade options are also available.",
