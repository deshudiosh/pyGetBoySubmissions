Paint bleeds and disperses through opposing colors, creating waves and sculpted forms, with overlays of classic lace drape and contour, drifting and rippling across the surface. Liike, using Definity, Durkan\u2019s exclusive manufacturing technology which surpasses traditional luxury carpet by offering incredible multi-level textures, more than twice the definition, superior performance and unmatched sustainability, as well as the same level of customization found with Axminster. All of the nuances of translating ink patterning into carpet/ area rugs are made possible in this collection through the technological advances and multi-level cut and loop capabilities of Definity.",
