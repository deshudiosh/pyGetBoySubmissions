"description_html": "The Catia bench brings refinement and sophistication to a category of product that is often monotonous in a space. Catia incorporates a sleek, yet substantial cushion, which creates a streamlined silhouette. Light and airy in appearance, the bench features an elliptical fin base combined with a gently curved top. The upholstered seat is accented with a welt around the perimeter and a saddle stitch through the center of the seat on leather and non-railroaded fabrics. The seat is seamless when fabrics are railroaded. Catia can be selected with a frame in solid American walnut or solid American maple and is available in any fabric or leather from Bernhardt Textiles or the customer\u2019s own material.<br/><br/>Catia's refinement and sophistication to a category of product that is often monotonous in a space.
