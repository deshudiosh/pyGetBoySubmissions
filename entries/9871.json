"description_html": "Our newest collection of timeless glazed terracotta tiles - eastern earthenware. Inspired by Moroccan zellige - but created using far east sensibilities, eastern earthenware is a creation of primitive tiles hand-formed from rustic terra cotta then hardened using ancient firing methods and kilns. The great tradition of ceramics received huge momentum from Asia from the discovery of new forms of clay to the experimentation with minerals to colorize glazes. It is this influence that has provided the heart of our collection. eastern earthenware features over 30 glazes that are highly textured, gloriously imperfect and infused with the most unexpected color variations. This concert of elements can only be derived from an artisan\u2019s hand using unfiltered elements freshly mined from nature and further distinguished by the use of a volatile firing atmosphere. Available in 2\"x6\", 3\"x8\", 4\"x4\" and 6\"x6\" sizes. we encourage you to explore this series for any of your bath or kitchen splashes, your walls and floors, and your interior or exterior spaces.",
