With 5 new designs in a myriad of color ways, the grouping is striking, fresh, and eye catching.<br/><br/>The NEW LANDS Collection is available in showrooms across the United States, Australia, and Canada. The collection was released in May 2017 and to date has been featured in The World of Interiors, The New York Times, House and Home, LA Home, Beach Magazine and Modern Luxury.<br/><br/>Each print is adapted from Perdigon\u2019s own original artwork whether it is block prints, paintings, or travel sketches. With inspirations ranging from Indian miniature paintings to African Kente cloths, the global influence is apparent.<br/><br/>An adamant supporter of the age old craft of silk screen, Perdigon works closely with a team of skilled artisans who hand screen the production of each textile. All designs are printed on luxurious Belgian linen in Los Angeles, California. The textiles are suitable for drapery, upholstery, and soft furnishings for residential design applications.",
