"description_html": "The basis is a circle that extends upwards into an imaginary square: Like a petal, the easy chair Flint unfolds to create the basic shape of a calyx. In terms of formal design, it can be compared to the methods used in sculpture. Everything that is superfluous has been cut away to reveal the flowing contours of the body, the back, the armrests and the round seating surface on the inside. The result is a comparatively delicate, compact individual easy chair. Flint is rotatable and requires little space, while offering plenty of legroom and a high degree of seating comfort. With its formal separation, 'stern on the outside, soft on the inside', it works best as a soloist, but is still easily combinable. This idea can also be applied to the selection of the cover materials. Easy chairs and stools can be designed individually with contrasting colours and materials. The borderline between the inside and outside is emphasized by a circumferential seam. Cover materials: All fabrics and leathers from the COR Collection.",
