"description_html": "A blend of two of nature\u2019s most evocative colors finds expression in Kohler\u2019s newest offering for its Vibrant faucet finishes \u2014 Rose Gold. True to its name, this finish offers a warmth and brilliance, maintaining a balance between luster and allure that conveys softness, refinement and celebration. <br/>Stunning on both classic and contemporary faucet styles, Rose Gold draws the eye to elegant neutral tones without losing its own distinctive character. <br/><br/> Rose Gold provides homeowners, designers and architects alike with a focal point of unyielding subtlety. This finish fits well across many palettes and is available in a broad range of faucets and accessories for coordinated bathroom solutions.<br/><br/>Created through Kohler\u2019s patented Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD), a faucet in Rose Gold displays a warm sheer and possesses a flawless consistency that resists tarnish and corrosion. The PVD process vaporizes a coating finish material and deposits it on the faucet for a super hard surface resulting in faucet finishes that twice exceed the industry durability standard.<br/><br/>PVD results in a mechanically strong finish that is ceramic in nature and resists tarnishing, scratching and corrosion. The environmentally friendly process creates no waste because no harmful chemicals or significant volume of water is used. From the time a faucet component begins the PVD process after being chrome-plated until it arrives in the hands of an inspector is three hours, about half of which is used to prepare the surface for finishing.",
