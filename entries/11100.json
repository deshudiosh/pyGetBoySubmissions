"description_html": "Designed by international award winning designer Tina Nicole, the Cielo lounge features a deep diamond tufted seating series which features movable, \u201cfloating\u201d back cushions that may be rearranged in a 360-degree pattern to fit any configuration of sitters for easy socializing. The cushions are weighted, providing ample support while still being easy to move and reconfigure. The result: Cielo can be formal, relaxed or lounge-y, depending on how the cushions are arranged. Cielo floats on an upholstered plinth base whose channels are precisely married to the exit of every diamond tuft. Four sofa lengths are available and customizable.",
