SketchTable\u2122 is offered in two sizes; 16-inch and 24-inch, perfect for playing games, doing homework and even labeling those delicious appetizers for your guests at your next cocktail party. The taller size makes a lovely accent piece for a front entryway where reminders can be left, for a child\u2019s play or study table or even as a practical and enjoyable end table. Each table has a two-sided flip top, giving the chance to have two writable surfaces you can simply flip when your project or artistic mood changes. Two surface options are available. The first is the Formica\u00ae Writable Surface with the ColorBook design on the front and black ChalkAble design on the back. The second Formica\u00ae Writable Surface option is the LoveWords design on the front and black ChalkAble design on the back. Price: $150.",
