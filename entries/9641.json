Our team of designers and artists under the direction of Deborah Moss, works closely with our clients to develop inspired wall coverings that are cohesive with the design intent and thoughtfully integrated with the space. <br/><br/>Our approach to developing wall coverings is tailored to suit each specific client and our process includes: initial art concepts, sample development, in-house fabrication, and installation. <br/><br/>Our 14,000 sq. ft. Toronto studio, allows us to create seamless canvas wall coverings measuring up to 17\u2019 x 100\u2019. One of our recent projects, the Four Seasons, Kuwait, contains over 14,000 sq. ft. of wall coverings.<br/><br/>All of our work is hand produced; each finish is an original (hand made) and available in a variety of styles and techniques, including carved plasters on canvas, painted gradients, imaginative murals and gilded surfaces. Moss and Lam has created canvas wall coverings for locations throughout the world including Kuwait, Hong Kong, New York, Dubai, Paris, Japan and India. <br/><br/>All of our wall coverings are ASTM E84 Class A certified.",
