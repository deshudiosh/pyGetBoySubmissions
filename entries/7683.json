"description_html": "Sachet by Jehs+Laub is an elegant fully upholstered chair designed to serve a multitude of applications. Dominated by soft forms, fine tailored upholstery details, and a sophisticated style, Sachet presents comfort and style restructured.<br/>Sachet wows in the smallest details, with no design feature left unaccounted. The striking form of Sachet demands attention. Its upholstery details include a surrounding welt and classic stitch details. Not only does this add visual interest but also serves to secure the upholstery for a sophisticated look that won\u2019t wear out.<br/>A wide range of options creates the basis for this elegant new family. Sachet is offered in mid back and low back heights with five base options: wire base, four leg metal base, four leg wood base, five star caster base, and four prong caster base. Each base tells its own unique design story, offering elegant details to complement the delicate details of the shell.<br/>Sachet ushers in a new generation of seating with an innovative seat suspension system and flexible back construction providing long-lasting comfort and durability. Sachet\u2019s innovative design is concealed within the chair shell. Springs, molded into the foam shell, create unexpected comfort in the seat and back, especially considering the thin profile of Sachet. With a classic design language, Sachet is broadening horizons in the modern office. The style is soft, delicate, and sleek with a surprising level of strength, durability, and support.",
