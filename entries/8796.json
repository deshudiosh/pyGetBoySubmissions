"description_html": "The \u201cGeometric\u201d ventless fireplace is available this fall. Breaking the longstanding tradition of box fireplaces, the new design works because there is no venting required. A traditional shape usually encourages air to move up a flue, but that\u2019s no longer a restriction with custom ventless geometric options, including trapezoids, hexagons, triangles, parallelograms and more.<br/> <br/>Shown is a custom trapezoidal HearthCabinet, sloped on one side, making it a perfect contemporary shape for a mountain abode or dynamic Manhattan apartment. This particular matte black herringbone tiled interior meshes the contemporary design with traditional fireplace details that make a statement, whether placed in either a traditional or contemporary home.",
