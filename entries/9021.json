"description_html": "With the goal of developing a modern freestanding bathtub that is both beautifully sculptural and highly<br/>functional, Waterworks and Lee Mindel, Principal Architect, Shelton, Mindel and Associates, took<br/>inspiration from the Renaissance period - a time when baths were carved with substantial size and<br/>thickness, notably different to the thin forms of many of today\u2019s freestanding bathtubs. Contrary to how<br/>Renaissance baths were created by chipping away pieces from a large block of material, Formwork is<br/>made of Lithic, poured natural stone dust and resin, creating a sculptural modern form that is then hand<br/>polished.<br/><br/>The Formwork collection was designed with a heavy focus on how water is held and with respect to the<br/>capabilities of the material. The new set of bathtubs include styles that can be freestanding, set within a niche, integrated with shower stalls enclosures, or project from a wall, allowing for more cubic feet of bathing space in a footprint. The Formwork bathtubs have a larger tub deck or edge that can accommodate bathing accessories - soaps, brushes, sponges, even an iPad.<br/><br/>Made from Lithic, our proprietary natural stone and epoxy resin composite material<br/>Lithic material has superior insulating properties, ensuring maximum heat retention in the bathtub<br/>Each piece is individually cast and finished with more than 20 hours of hand polishing<br/>Can be installed as freestanding or in an alcove with use of optional tile flange set (UNFL01).
