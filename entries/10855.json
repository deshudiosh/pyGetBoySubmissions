"description_html": "The need to connect, to reflect, to simply stand still and be in the moment, is ever more compelling. As our schedules leave little time for reflection, and our digital lives remove us from our senses, we yearn for the calming power of a soft surface, the visual harmony found in nature, for physical connection. Off the Grid is a deeply textural collection, of undulating patterns that mirror the natural world, contour lines that dip and yield, boundaries that blur the edges, abstract forms, forging deeper connections to the world around us.<br/><br/>The team explored natural environments completely disconnected from their daily roles and technology. Immersing themselves in the journey and drawn, with a sense of curiosity, to details often overlooked, they found themselves marveling at micro and macro environments. From grand landscapes to delicate and intricate patterns in moss, spider webs, and trails carved by beetles, the passion for design was reignited. The designers interpreted their observations into patterns and created textures that are reminiscent of their journeys. This collection is a product of our design team\u2019s experience of reconnecting to their craft by disconnecting from their routine. <br/><br/>This collection is deeply textural and can be used to create subtle or dynamic shifts in scale and texture density. These designs evoke colors, textures and pattern from nature and brings the human touch indoors \u2013 answering the human desire for connection with nature. Off the Grid, is a product that can bring Biophilic element to our built environments. The increased need for quiet and contemplative time in the workplace is answered by this collection that draws you in and calms through its palette and ever-changing, irregular textural landscape. <br/><br/>Off the Grid is a collection of two standard broadlooms styles that meet multiple price points and design needs. With subtitle tight texture for busy office environments and a plush texture designed to create impact and moments of pause, the variety within the collection provides designers with a product language and the ability to create unique and moments while feeling connected to a larger visual language. The collection also includes custom carpet patterns with large organic and abstract motifs that create scale and drama. Designed to work across a variety of commercial environments, these patterns can be used to create bold or reflective moments. Eye-catching large patterns create a sense of scale and grandeur. Small-scale textures and abstract patterns combine to create a sense of wonder and discovery. <br/><br/>The color palette in Off The Grid provides flexibility for the product to be co-specified with other floorings and finishes.
