"description_html": "The concept is derived from forming a simple wooden chair with two crossing bent members. The resulting visual effect is a bit uncanny; it looks at once unfinished and also like it's a double-chair. It has some inspiration from minimal Ming-styled scholar chairs, just that they are crossed to form an x-bracing back support.",
