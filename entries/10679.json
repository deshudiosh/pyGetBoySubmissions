"description_html": "Architects and designers are looking for new ways to create built environments in harmony with nature's forces, and shade structures are increasingly beginning the design conversation rather than being an afterthought or accessory.<br/><br/>Jacquard shade fabrics Avenues and Cirrus emphasize the growing desire for shade that is equally matched in design and in performance.<br/><br/>Avenues is a Mondrian-inspired design featuring a large-scale color block. With a contemporary aesthetic, this asymmetrical block stripe is ideal for a modern home or commercial setting. Avenues is 54\u201d wide and available in colors Daylight (neutral tones white, flax and gravel) and Midnight (darker tones black, blue and charcoal).<br/><br/>Named for the thin, wispy cloud formation, Cirrus portrays an allover cloud look. Multiple weaves give this fabric the illusion of layering or clouds floating. Suited for both traditional shade applications and more unique cabanas and other shade structures, Cirrus is 54\u201d wide and available in colors Dove (cool gray tone) and Sand (warm linen tone).<br/><br/>Avenues and Cirrus utilize a traditional fabric construction, ideal for upscale, highly decorative applications. Because the color is embedded deep inside each and every fiber, both fabrics are easy to care for, fade proof, and bleach cleanable.",
