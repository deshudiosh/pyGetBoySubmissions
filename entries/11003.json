"description_html": "With the 2757 sectional sofa we wanted to address the modular and easily adaptable nature of both residential and office projects we see as a staple in contemporary design. The solid handmade stainless steel legs support a clean lined blind-tufted seat cushion. A walnut table with a touch-latch seamlessly integrated drawer caps one end, adding elegant contrast as well as storage and versatility. To A. Rudin this piece personifies modern living: clean lines, comfortable, highly detailed, and easily customizable.",
