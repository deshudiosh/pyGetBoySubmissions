Shift explores conceptual approaches using a progressive combination of pattern, color and texture. With its focus on design and inspiration, the publication features artistically intriguing images that capture imagination and possibility. Gracefully integrating J+J product and installation configuration options alongside thought-provoking photo vignettes, Shift is at once both a practical resource and an inspirational guide. <br/><br/>New editions of Shift are published throughout the year and each include a series of exploratory concepts which will shift perspectives to provide new ideas in the application of commercial floor covering. <br/><br/>In Volume one of \u201cShift,\u201d \u201cHighlight\u201d explores the utilization of thoughtfully placed color accents to create a memorable design them, \u201cSync\u201d artfully shows how function and flair can be achieved by pairing relevant floor types within a singular space and, \u201cFresh\u201d reveals new perspectives on merging patterns with color create intentional focus on space, function and direction. <br/><br/>The second volume of \u201cShift\u201d, titled Hyperbole, presents the striking splendor of exaggerated color and creativity, bold decisions and beautiful statements.
