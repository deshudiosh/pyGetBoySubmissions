"description_html": "Fire Farm redefines light and sound with the new Feltgood Light Collection. <br/><br/>A study in textural contrasts, glossy white acrylic is paired with soft colorful felt and fashioned into simple bold geometric pendants. The felt sides, a durable polyester made with 50% post-consumer recycled content, appear to be \u201cstitched\u201d into shape by the light glowing from the acrylic tabs. The sound-dampening qualities of the fabric make the Feltgood pendants an excellent choice for creating quieter spaces in hard interiors. <br/><br/>Hung individually, the scale of the Feltgood pendants can be a dramatic focal point in both traditional and modern interiors. The eight colorways and extensive shapes give the designer a full palette of options to create custom lighting environments. <br/><br/>Node-point shapes are available to create wayfinding lighting paths or large pattern arrays that take advantage of both negative and positive space.",
