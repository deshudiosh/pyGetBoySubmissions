"description_html": "Kesch rugs beg to be touched. They combine traditional and unexpected fibers-- hand-carded wool, Mongolian cashmere, and hand-spun silk from India-- in variegated colors and novel finishing techniques with precisely executed design. With our talented Afghan, Tibetan, and Indian artisans, we create hand-knotted textures that elevate rugs from two-dimensional floor coverings to fully designed objects that are not merely seen, but experienced.",
