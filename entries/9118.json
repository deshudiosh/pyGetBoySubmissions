"description_html": "In collaboration with Rich Brilliant Willing, Meyer Davis designed a new lighting collection including the two pieces: Hoist and Pilot, pendant and sconce collections that combine cutting-edge technology with casual sophistication. With a shared taste for simplicity and \u201cintelligent subtraction,\u201d the two studios developed timeless fixtures suited to a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments, uniquely solving common interior design problems. <br/>The Hoist, a pendant, sconce, and flush mount, was designed as an elegant solution for a routine problem; hospitality renovations often lack electrical access to hang a pendant light where it is desired. The question became, how to make the electrical cord part of a larger gesture? Having identified the out-of-reach electrical outlet as a routine problem, the studios adapted the standard electrical cord as an integral, stylish component of Hoist\u2019s overall design. Swagged and offered with generous cable length, the cord allows greater opportunities for where a pendant light can be installed. A knurled cord grip gives infinite freedom to locate a light source. The shade is available in a variety of colors and diameters, with a sconce version as well. Waterproof, the highly durable exterior is also suitable for outdoor installation, creating the possibility for a cohesive interior and exterior. <br/>We developed tools for designers to create their own atmosphere. Thoughtfully considered and meticulously executed, the pieces elevate practical features like accent finishes and durable materials with a relaxed elegance, adding endless possibilities for installation.",
