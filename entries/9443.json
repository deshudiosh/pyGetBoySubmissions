"description_html": "Designed by Spanish-designer, Jordi L\u00f3pez Aguil\u00f3 of Kutarq Studio, Just Fold It is a reconfigurable and portable desktop screen. The faceted screen has individual panels of 100% wool felt mounted to a durable stay material and uses integral and flexible nylon hinges to allow reconfiguration by simply shifting sections of the screen. These hinges also allow the screen to lay completely flat for efficient storage or roll up to be taken along. Available in three standard heights, the length of the screen may be ordered in custom lengths by adding or subtracting modules, making this design endlessly flexible on just about any worksurface. The nylon hinges come in a standard black to emphasize the faceted design and the felt covering is available in 63 colors. Want to mix it up? Multiple colors of felt may be specified to make a truly one-of-a-kind desktop screen.",
