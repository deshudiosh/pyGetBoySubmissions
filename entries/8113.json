"description_html": "A linear component sofa and armchair with a clean, contemporary look. The light structure welcomes generously padded goosedown cushions bordered by thick relief stitching. The base in metal tubing is covered in leather or fabric, raised off the floor by metal feet. The soft armrest and back cushions slide over the structure, and are crossed by original lengthwise stitching that produces a gentle hollow on the surface (in fabric or leather): an interesting graphic sign that becomes the distinctive feature of the sofa. The horizontal stitching on the armrest and back cushions follows and accentuates the natural folds creating by the act of sitting.",
