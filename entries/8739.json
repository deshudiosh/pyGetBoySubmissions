"description_html": "Our More Than Wood collection begins with textures developed by nature and transforms them into works of flooring art. For example, the Charred Wood series aesthetic is influenced by the Japanese technique called Yakisugi \u2013 where wood is charred to achieve an artistic and unique look \u2013 delivering exceptional character within each tile. Other series in the collection include Amalgamate, Circa, Heartwood, Public Hall, Sinker Cypress, Spalted, and Townhall. <br/>This state-of-the-art digitally printed collection combines the natural look of wood with the durability of LVT to deliver more than just a floor. Tarkett\u2019s digital print LVT yields a floor with much longer repeats \u2014 4 times longer than traditional LVT printing \u2014 and nearly endless design options. The variation in pattern provides tremendous shifts in the overall design, resulting in a more interesting space. The performance requirements and expectations of foot traffic in commercial education, healthcare, retail, and hospitality spaces can quickly degrade natural materials, resulting in environment disruption, lost productivity and replacement costs. The More Than Wood Collection, with its unsurpassed reproduction of natural materials, delivers both the desired benefits of proven LVT durability, with the complex, subtle aesthetics that nature so beautifully provides.<br/>The More Than Wood collection uses water based inks, is a low VOC-emitting product, carries FloorScore\u00ae certification, and incorporate a 32mil wear layer for longer life cycles. All materials used in the production process are 100% recyclable and phthalate-free.",
