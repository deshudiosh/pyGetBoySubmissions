"description_html": "Cube+ One shape, many options. Make it yours - use one or many, go geometric or random, be simple or complex. <br/>A modular lampshade made from modular parts. The modular parts form a modular cube. The cube can be used as a single lampshade or pendant, or the cubes can be interlocked in a multitude of ways to form large or small \u2018clouds\u2019. They can be formed and reformed as wished. <br/>Kris Ericksen is a New Zealand-based designer. He is an Emerging Talent Honoree Award winner in the 2016 NYCxDESIGN Awards and a two times finalist in the World of Wearable Arts (WOW) Awards. His modular approach to creating unique and flexible designs from simple geometric shapes brings new-found creativity and inspiration to everyday objects. He imagines a world where people have a hand in the design of their own household accessories. Now anyone can custom-create their own modular light shades \u2013 using the Plato System. The added beauty is that the Plato System can be unclipped and redesigned again and again.",
