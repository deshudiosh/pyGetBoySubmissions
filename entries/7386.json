"description_html": "Aesthetically minimal yet full of movement and sensuality, HALO is a bespoke display that features McCormick\u2019s celebrated Halo light. A series of pendants will cascade from ceiling to oor creating the illusion of elegant hanging jewels. Originally conceived as a graphical interpretation of e ervescence, the Halo series is a bold family of lighting xtures inspired by the golden bub-bles oating in an Italian Prosecco. Their modular system allows the pendants to be suspended in a multitude of compositions. Halo echoes McCormick\u2019s desire to convey precision, while inspir-ing the closeness and personal touch that jewelry brings. Machined to perfection so that it both houses the electronics and look sleek, the Halo lights are available in brass, copper, nickel and 24 karat gold nishes.",
