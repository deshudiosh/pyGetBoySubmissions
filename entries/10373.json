"description_html": "Cement has been an amazing building material for eons. The patterns and colors have evolved over its history but have tended to very traditional designs. Paul Schatz has taken cement tiles to a whole new level by introducing time-honored motifs with updated twists and a modern palette. You\u2019ll see influences from cultures all over the world\u2014Moorish, Native American, Arabic, Italian, Spanish, and many more, all refreshed by Paul\u2019s artful eye.<br/>Tango Tile is proud to suggest Paul\u2019s Encanto Collection for a BOY Award.",
