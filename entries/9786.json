The Swedish duo reinterpret the two elements with a contemporary flair, enhancing their features and aesthetics by using the circle as a geometric motif in the backrest, seat and armrest, and the characteristics thanks to the new technical mesh on the backrest, presented for the first time by GTV , which gives it a modern and attractive appearance. This feminine, eclectic chair is suspended in time.
