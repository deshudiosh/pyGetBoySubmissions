"description_html": "Shaw Contract relaunched A Walk in the Garden this year, a fresh take on a collection which helped pioneer the Cradle to Cradle\u00ae Product Standard. This collection\u2019s design framework helped drive the development of the Cradle to Cradle certification process to inventory, screen, assess and optimize everything Shaw Contract makes \u2013 with a focus on human health and safety. This collection is a testament to Shaw Contract\u2019s commitment to designing responsible products \u2013 then and now.I n collaboration with visionary architect and sustainability advocate William McDonough, the collection features four styles in a 9 x 36 in (23 x 91 cm) format and a refreshed color palette of ten core colors. The collection was inspired by William McDonough's visit to a garden in China, where he was struck by the harmony of man-made weathered surfaces in nature.<br/><br/>McDonough's personal images from the garden in China are raw and simple, and beautifully illustrate how sustainable design is the catalyst for the collection's carpet tile patterns. The collection features different patterns, much like those found in a garden, to create color, texture and variety. Collection styles are applicable across market segments. Custom options are also available.<br/><br/>Constructed with Eco Solution Q nylon and EcoWorx backing, these products are recyclable and contribute to LEED. This collection is also backed by a lifetime commercial warranty covering abrasive wear, tuft-bind, edge ravel and delamination.",
