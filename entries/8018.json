"description_html": "The Andreen table is a simple, artistic, and functional table featuring a beveled underside edge on the table top and an interlocking base. The bevel creates the allusion of a thinner top and helps draw your eyes from the top to the base. The base features two center stretchers that lock into the legs and have removable end caps that are attached using hidden fasteners. The top stretcher and legs have multiple connection points to the table top that create a strong connection while also allowing the top to expand and contract. The table is designed to ship broken down and flat and can be assembled in 30 minutes.",
