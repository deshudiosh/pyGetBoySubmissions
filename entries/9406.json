"description_html": "Wools of New Zealand invited ESTI BARNES, Creative Director of TOPFLOOR by ESTI , to design the very first rug to use their new, all natural and 'whitest yet' GLACIAL XT (tm) wool yarn. The frothy petticoats of the dancers in the Moulin Rouge was the first image that sprang to mind and so CANCAN took to the stage with its swirling, lacy tiers of carved border detail surrounding a snowy white cut pile ground. As a somewhat Zen-influenced designer, it was only natural for Esti to want to create a second rug that was both a contrast and yet at the same time a soul mate to CANCAN's feminine flounces. The result was the angular and distinctly masculine FANFAN cast in slivers of steely grey bamboo silk and menacing black wool cutpile.",
