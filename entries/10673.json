"description_html": "Through the use of alternating materials and the interplay of solids and voids, VVD gives rise to a dynamic and sophisticated kitchen. Features include generous pull-out trays, open-ended drawers and under top trolleys. Innovation is expressed with technological details such as the built-in LED strip light and the aluminum profile that discreetly designs the door edge, which improves the grip and pivot hinge allowing the door to open 180 degrees. Thanks to the elegant ceiling units and slim, transparent glass cupboards with soft-closing micro-hinges, this kitchen offers its users a new architectural look.",
