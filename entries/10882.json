"description_html": "Boundary\u2122 Metallics is a modern take on concrete that gives the appearance of a metallized, eroded surface. As part of Interface\u2019s unique modular flooring design system, Boundary Metallics complements Global Change\u2122, a global collection launched earlier this year. Inspired by man-made, industrial materials aged by the elements, Boundary Metallics serves as a striking counterpart to the natural textures of a variety of Interface\u2019s carpet tile collections, including Global Change. Three colorways are now available in the U.S. \u2013 Fawn, Daylight and Eclipse. Three additional colors \u2013 Morning Mist, Evening Dusk and Desert Shadow \u2013 will be available in November.<br/><br/>Unlike many LVT products on the market, Boundary Metallics is offered in 25cm x 100cm Skinny Planks\u2122, with the rectangular shape providing more visual depth than traditional square tiles. Because the product is offered in Skinny Plank size and engineered to compatible height to other Interface offerings, it affords designers the ability to effortlessly and creatively pair hard and soft products without transition strips. <br/><br/>While Boundary Metallics offers an on-trend dynamic aesthetic, it also meets performance standards like sound quality, which makes it ideal for multi-family or hospitality environments. The product\u2019s Sound Choice\u2122 proprietary backing (certified by Quiet Mark) meets acoustical sound requirements for reducing vertical sound transfer.",
