"description_html": "Yabu Pushelberg\u2019s deceptively simple pieces for Glas Italia, though both very different, each impart a rarefied elegance, resulting from an approach that explores the technical limitations of glass and plays with the material\u2019s most fundamental qualities.<br/>From a very simple form, understood at first glance, comes a piece of furniture with expressive, playful nuances. Disciplined, pared back lines, flat planes, purposeful arcs and square edges quietly celebrate the qualities of clear glass and Glas Italia\u2019s precision craftsmanship. Inspired by the innocent approachability of folded paper, the minimal Folio desk is smart and friendly.",
