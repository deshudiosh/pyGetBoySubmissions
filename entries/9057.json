"description_html": "Alt Piazza is a collection of open, caf\u00e9-style work environments. Okamura created the collection to support the values of the emerging workforce by encouraging casual collaboration and natural-being. The collection standardizes the specification process for work bars and ensures consistent, superlative quality. Surfaces are finished with the texture and aesthetic of reclaimed wood in a low-maintenance laminate. Optional power outlets are located under the bar top, with concealed wire management along the legs. The collection is comprised of bars, counters, tables and seating, and will soon include elegant, touch-activated lighting and more open collaborative settings.",
