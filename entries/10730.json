"description_html": "When a guest walks through the doors of Ion City, a boutique Icelandic hotel, the Nest fixture is the first thing there to greet them. The interwoven fixture, perched above the reception desk, welcomes guests with the universal symbol of home. Diffused light radiates through the freely intertwined reeds made of steel. The delicate weaving motion juxtaposes the rock solid material, steel \u2013 there to protects all who dwells within. Like the migrating bird, the Nest makes Ion City every traveler\u2019s home-away-from home.",
