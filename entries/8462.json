"description_html": "\u201cLess is more\u201d has long been a minimalist design principle, and it\u2019s one that Rocky Mountain Hardware has recently put into practice, creating a collection of door sets reflective of the aesthetic. \u201cEdge\u201d is the new arrival, distinguished by an escutcheon that measures 2 inches wide vs. the standard 2.5-inch. This slimmer, narrower style adds a more contemporary choice to Rocky Mountain\u2019s swelling portfolio of products, and answers the call from architect and interior designer clients for hardware that has a smaller dimension . With the launch of \u201cEdge\u201d also come two new textured finishes exclusive to the series: Wire is a tactile as well as visual tease, with a tangle of lines enwrapping the surface; and Moonscape has a fluidity that\u2019s frozen in place, created by a bronze over pour in production and resulting in an intriguing motif. In addition to these edgier treatments, \u201cEdge\u201d is offered in four other texture options that have long been in Rocky Mountain\u2019s lineup along with a choice of 10 high quality finishes that are signatures of the brand\u2019s art-bronze construction. Ideal for residential as well as commercial projects, the \u201cEdge\u201d group includes a complete offering of all door hardware functions\u2014from entry to interior and even sliding. From the company\u2019s inception, customization has been a core tenet, and it\u2019s especially applicable with \u201cEdge.\u201d Architects and interior designers can specify their style of lever to match with the \u201cEdge\u201d escutcheon plate, plus propose individualized adaptions and modifications to satisfy a client\u2019s tastes and needs. Nickum suggested one of the optimum ways to begin the selection process is to visit the company\u2019s \u201cDesign Your Own\u201d digital tool on its website, an easily navigable program for mixing and matching components and deciding choices.",
