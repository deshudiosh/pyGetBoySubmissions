"description_html": "OPUS table, design Antonio Citterio, in wood. It is produced using fine techniques and details, such as shaped solid wood and dovetail joints. The outer frame holds the inner slats firmly in place. Solid wood turned legs. Available wood: Walnut colour, Teak, Fum\u00e9 Oak, Fossil Oak. It is available as workbench in slatted NTF (Natural Touch Finish) wood.<br/>Presented at the recent edition of Eurocucina, its grained wood in a \u201crough\u201d finish matches perfectly with stainless steel in the innovative colours generated with the PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition) technological process. Natural materials, innovative production technologies and artisan details in a dialogue with each other and with the evolution of work zones.<br/>The limelight is on clever use of materials: steel as Arclinea\u2019s heritage in technological innovation for finishes, and wood as a historic value, rendered unique and precious by artisan skills and surprising production processes.",
