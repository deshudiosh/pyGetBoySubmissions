"description_html": "Franke\u2019s award-winning Pescara faucets have architecturally precise lines and are sold in a variety of styles. Pescara\u2019s Semi-Professional faucets \u2013 available in three sizes \u2013 feature 360-degree spout swivel ranges and intuitive switches that allow users to easily toggle between full and needle spray. One Pescara Semi-Professional faucet model (available in either satin nickel or polished chrome) features an innovative, dual-function hose: water flows effortlessly from the spout when it's in its magnetic docking station; simply remove the hose from its dock, touch a toggle switch, and it transforms into a spray hose that has extended reach to every corner of the sink. Once finished, simply set the hose back into the dock, and the faucet spray reverts to its original full flow path. This unique feature doubles the spray reach and minimizes the hose length. <br/><br/>Franke\u2019s Pescara faucets are sold exclusively at Franke retailers for an MSRP between $395 and $795 (depending on style and finish).
