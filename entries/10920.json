"description_html": "Terrazzo, wood and resin substrates punctuated with light pillars form this uniquely experiential material that transfers light, shadow, movement and colors beyond its surface to make a floating secondary surface come to life with a dynamic visual output that can be actively controlled or allowed to be affected by prevailing ambient conditions. A secondary surface created by light pillars is the hallmark of PIXA\u2122 Dimensional. 3-dimensional forms and patterns can be achieved by varying the height of pillars. This combined with LEDs creates a unique cube shaped light that adds something special to any space.",
