"description_html": "HBF and Danish design group SPACE Copenhagen have masterfully combined form and function with the exquisite handcrafted Harmoni Table. True to the HBF aesthetic, the piece evokes a modern perspective with a unique design.<br/><br/>Harmoni provides a lasting, pragmatic table that is also refined and rich in sensory experience with its uncommon yet chic shape. The Harmoni tabletop, made with solid light Ash wood, is entirely curved, with the exception of the very center. This graceful slope and intuitive shape comfortably fits the table edges to the shape of the human body, creating an approachable, communal piece. Harmoni\u2019s design form humanizes the classic office table and reinvigorates the corporate environment, blurring the line between the office and the home. <br/><br/>The Harmoni is not only aesthetically versatile, but is also technically designed to be functional in a variety of different environments. The piece is flexible and adaptable in terms of environment and reconfiguration. Available in varying lengths, widths, and heights, the Harmoni lends itself to a variety of settings and differing needs of the user. <br/><br/>Created with HBF\u2019s high standards for durability and sustainability, Harmoni is built with warm ash that will age gracefully in years to come. The high level of craftsmanship present in the woodworking and seamless detailing with metal accents all add to the Harmoni Table\u2019s lasting durability and artisan workmanship.",
