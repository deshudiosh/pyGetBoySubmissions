"description_html": "Charmed by shared social experiences implicit in the legacy of cut crystal cocktail glasses, Yabu Pushelber\u2019s Cipher collection for Lasvit is a juxtaposition of heritage techniques and modern form. Inspired by the versatility and texture of surface patterning and the way in which it catches the light, the delicate hand-blown crystal ellipsoid and cylindrical pieces are cut with clean, clear lines. With components arranged in series, joined by polished brass connections that emit light, the overall linear form creates a poetic visual rhythm. Regardless of the configuration, there is an inherent simplicity and earnestness in the effect of light playing off the delicate, perfectly clear etched glass.",
