"description_html": "The first collaboration between the Meda-based company and one of the design studios most appreciated for its exceptional ability to interpret the informal spirit of outdoor spaces, led to the highly flexible Apsara outdoor seating system: a design that can be re-arranged every day according to requirements, with wood as the main feature for a domestic, contemporary interpretation of the typical deck. A platform arranged as an oasis of tranquillity where outdoor living can be enjoyed according to the time of day, one's schedule and one's guests. The base is available in two sizes: classic and extra-large, for those who prefer more generous, comfortable proportions. With a carob coloured aluminium frame with sections in afrormosia wood, the system leaves space for comfortable back cushions with completely water-proof covers, which, combined with those of the chair, become structural elements that are still movable and removable to allow maximum flexibility throughout the day. A collection of textiles with especially refined colours and textures, less common in outdoor furniture, further enhances the infinite possibilities for customising this seating system. As if designed as accessories, small, round, square and rectangular tables complete the scene and provide useful surfaces.",
