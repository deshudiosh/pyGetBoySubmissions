"description_html": "Created by Dutch designers Wiebe Boonstra and Marc van Nederpelt of DUM Office, BuzziCane is a soft lounge collection that combines modern comfort with fun, retro materials and updated aesthetics. <br/><br/>With a woven cane back, wood base, and plush upholstery, the BuzziCane sofa brings a fresh, vintage-inspired look into contemporary environments. <br/><br/>Conceived around DUM Office\u2019s design philosophy, \u201cSprezzatura,\u201d which is defined by \u201ca certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make whatever one does\u2026 appear without effort,\u201d BuzziCane has a simple, welcoming appearance that invites one to sink back and relax. <br/><br/>Also a hallmark of both DUM Office and BuzziSpace is the sofa\u2019s playful and clean, yet edgy design \u2013 with a firm, elevated structure and natural rattan inserts that harmoniously contrast with the soft, comfy seat and back cushions, BuzziCane successfully walks the line between vintage and contemporary, formal and informal, making it an innovative and incredibly versatile piece. The design achieves this balance through the untraditional way in which natural rattan \u2014 BuzziCane\u2019s most traditional material \u2014 is incorporated into the seat\u2019s design, by emphasizing its openness and braided structure. Additionally, by having BuzziCane\u2019s sleek curved ash wood frame \u201cdrip off\u201d into the loose, informal pillows of its seat and back, the sofa provides an enticing, welcoming atmosphere, without entirely shedding its formal characteristics. <br/><br/>As a result of its multi-faceted design, BuzziCane is well-suited for many different types of environments, from lounge seating in private offices and collaborative workspaces, to hospitality settings and residential homes. It is also available as a one, two, or three seater, and in a wide range of colorful upholstery options, to meet the spatial and aesthetic needs of any space. In addition, its frame can come either in an ash natural, or an ash black stained finish. <br/><br/>With a highly adaptable personality and appearance, BuzziCane was designed in direct response to the changing state of the workplace \u2013 companies are gravitating away from the formal, and towards more comfortable, residential-inspired spaces that foster wellbeing, collaboration, and personal expression. BuzziCane\u2019s reassuring, unpretentious atmosphere not only facilitates these values, but also addresses the larger, growing necessity for flexible designs. As the line between work and life becomes increasingly blurred, versatile and highly functional products that can meet the needs of both have become crucial to the modern workforce. BuzziCane represents BuzziSpace\u2019s shift towards such products that can toe the line between residential and contract, without sacrificing aesthetics or functionality.",
