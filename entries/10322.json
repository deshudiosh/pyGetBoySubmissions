"description_html": "Interbraid \u2013 A New Contemporary Design by Hartmann&amp;Forbes<br/>The process of creating luxury woven products is drawn-out from nature by choosing only the finest sustainable natural materials. Ramie fibers of pale grey and golden wheat are hung to dry, hand-braided then individually placed in this handwoven-to-size grassweave. Rising above a finely woven field, these delicate braids create a unique horizontal pattern, resulting in a gentle rhythm. A modern design which lends a natural restfulness and comfort to any interior space.<br/><br/>A time-honored method of shade making, Hartmann&amp;Forbes\u2019 Woven-to-Size Collections are handwoven on traditional wooden looms to the window\u2019s dimensions, up to 180\" wide without seams. This arduous weaving technique delivers an exquisite loom-finished edge. Each shade is then handcrafted to designer\u2019s specifications, creating a true one-of-one original piece of art.",
