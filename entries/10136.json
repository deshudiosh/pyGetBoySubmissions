"description_html": "Vinylife by Fil Doux Textiles is an innovative game-changer for the textile industry. Produced with a natural enzyme which reacts to microorganisms found in biologically active landfills and that acts as the catalyst for its decomposition, the material is now treated with Pro-Tech, the company\u2019s standout proprietary ink and stain protectant. <br/><br/>\u201cWe\u2019re so excited about this revolutionary product,\u201d says Fil Doux Textiles president Leonardo Novik. \u201cVinylife is a huge step forward for the marketplace. We now have access to the durability and cleanability of vinyl, with a significantly improved sustainability story, which speaks to our goal of providing products that are beautiful and environmentally aware.\u201d<br/><br/>Vinylife was accepted Material ConneXion, the comprehensive resource center dedicated to international material innovation, and achieved its enhanced status for biodegradability through the ASTM D5511 test method. The material\u2019s durability makes it ideal for use in commercial projects of all kinds, as well as in the home.<br/><br/>In fall 2017, the ARTE collection will update Fil Doux Textiles\u2019 Vinylife offerings, and will consist of sophisticated leather looks, ranging from natural beiges and browns to deep and expressive purples, greens, and reds. These new patterns provide an elegant touch of leather to any space, while being 100% cruelty free and maintaining a revolutionary, eco-friendly composition.",
