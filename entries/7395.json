"description_html": "The Strand collection is a contemporary exploration of light and form inspired by the desire to express the beauty and luminescence of the traditional string shade. The elemental profiles are rendered in a combination of materials and finishes that create a transitional and versatile suite. The artful technique of stringing the shades is uniquely expressed in each design. A soft glow emanates from the silk wrapped diffuser that finishes off the underside of each light.<br/><br/>The armature of the Rink chandelier is integrated with the shade by wrapping the frame with the fine silk-like cord while leaving some of the structural ribs expressed. <br/><br/>The Halo shade floats on a ring finished in antique brass. The oversized canopy reflects the warm glow from the light below and adds presence and drama.<br/><br/>Designed for a more intimate space, The Bower ceiling mount\u2019s traditional shade is combined with modern structural elements making for a truly transitional design.",
