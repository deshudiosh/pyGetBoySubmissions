"description_html": "Described as a perfect lobby rug by many design firms, Drift - Light Blue strikes a perfect balance between making a strong first impression and complementing the interior it sits within. Scale is the key \u2013 the larger the rug, the more it becomes an abstract sea of sand surrounded by blue shores. <br/><br/>As one of the happy owners puts it: \"Drift Light Blue combines oceanfront warmth with an oceanic coolness, flowing seamlessly together.\"<br/><br/>Hand-knotted with hand-carded and hand-spun wool at 200 knots per square inch to custom size.",
