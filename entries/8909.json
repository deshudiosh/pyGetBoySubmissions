"description_html": "The Affinity Collection of bold pulls and knobs are a stunning addition to any modern cabinet or furniture piece. There is bulk and weight to these pieces which are available in clear, white or gray glass, with polished chrome, polished nickel, satin nickel or satin brass bases. Pulls are available in 6\u201d, 8\u201d and 10\u201d lengths.<br/><br/>Sietto Handcrafted Cabinet Hardware fuses glass, making each piece by hand in the USA. We saw a need in the marketplace for distinctive, yet neutral, hardware. Designed to be bulky, and accommodate clear glass - an often requested option - this line of hardware has set itself apart from the crowd.",
