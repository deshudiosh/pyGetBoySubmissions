Offering a modern<br/>interpretation of the best of the 70\u2019s; touches of macram\u00e9, pointed collars and flared trousers can be seen throughout the patterns, bringing a retro modern twist to the collection while showcasing a fresh up to date feel with the beautifully synchronized colors. A contemporary twist on iconic trends of the past, the Met\u00e1fora Collection creates a statement that is both eye-catching and classic.
