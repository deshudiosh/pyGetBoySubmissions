"description_html": "New Mexico is known for its dramatic, wild and distressed beauty; Wolf-Gordon\u2019s new Origins Woods collection, developed in collaboration with the Museum of New Mexico, attempts to capture the allure of the region by focusing on weathered wood structures. Consisting of four digital wallcoverings, Origins Woods is printed on earth-friendly and breathable Terralon, and will join the company\u2019s Curated Collection.<br/><br/>The patterns in Origins Woods are photographically realistic, inspired by the barns, fences, and homes that are built of the material for siding, paneling and flooring. The wood is presented in different configurations as lengthwise cuts and cross sections. As these digital prints attest, wood is a canvas for diverse patinas and textures when exposed to the elements; its textural complexity makes it a sophisticated complement to a variety of interiors.<br/><br/>\"Wolf-Gordon Design Studio had the privilege of exploring the New Mexico landscape with the Museum of New Mexico staff to draw inspiration for this collection. Wood was a large part of that experience; and its unique, rich appearance contributes to our initiative to offer interesting textural elements in the Curated Collection.\" \u2013 Michael Loughlin, Wolf-Gordon, Customs &amp; Digital Director.<br/><br/>Catalpa, Pawpaw, Tamarack, and Tupelo add a warm, authentic touch to any space, whether positioned behind a headboard or a reception desk, or in a customer waiting area or retail environment.
