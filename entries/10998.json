"description_html": "A. Rudin introduces a collection of luxe furnishings created by the award-winning designer Sue Firestone, internationally known for elegant interiors for an elite clientele. Drawing upon the glamour of 70\u2019s chic and the casual beauty of California\u2019s haute Bohemian lifestyle, Firestone has partnered with A.Rudin to create a 18-piece collection of seductive upholstered seating and bold casegoods (a first for A. Rudin) and occasional tables. Each hand built and hand finished piece speaks to utmost quality and brings to life a philosophy of modern living defined by a sense of free-spirited ease and grace. <br/><br/>\u201cFor this collection, I drew inspiration from my Malibu roots, referencing designers that elicited a sense of feeling for me like the works of Michael Taylor and Steven Chase, who are both known for their quintessential California looks,\u201d explains Firestone. \u201cI found influence through anything that nodded to nature, serenity, and organic shapes and forms.\u201d<br/><br/>In addition to collaborating with their first female designer, this was also A. Rudin\u2019s foray into the world of casegoods. \u201cWe\u2019ve held off on casegoods in the past because we needed to be able to apply the same quality of flawlessness we do to our upholstered goods,\u201d explains Rudin. \u201cIn collaborating with Sue that opportunity presented itself and now we\u2019re creating pieces of art for the home in addition to luxe upholstery.\u201d",
