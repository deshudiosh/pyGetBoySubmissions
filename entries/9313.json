"description_html": "Lace is inspired by the characteristics of our faces and the secrets they reveal or conceal. Contrasting tones of grays and blacks add a sense of drama to the features of the woman. Using Innovated new techniques of twisted silk yarns with long threads and flat looped knots, a modern abstract pattern is created when viewed closely. Textures are introduced to add a third dimension to the face by long silk yarns overlapping each other as the monochrome of colors stand next to each other, revealing and concealing the design. The long silk yarns are flattened or raised as they form shadows across the face giving a further depth of wisdom across of the map of the face.",
