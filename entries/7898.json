"description_html": "This beautiful furniture vanity designed for the bathroom is created from walnut wood. The graining of this species of wood is a favorite of mine for its inherent natural beauty. Both door panels are hand sliced and pieced together to create the gorgeous starburst pattern. The legs are tapered and cylindrical, then capped with a soft gold metal to accentuate the body of the furniture. Hardware that is sleek and clean lined was added in a soft gold finish tying the body and legs together for a stunning look. To top it all off a classic and timeless Bianco Carrara 3 cm top with eased edge and rectangular undermount white porcelain sink was used.",
