"description_html": "The Linea vanity unites many separate elements into one indivisible unit. The delicate metal frame available in polished or brushed stainless steel, matte black or brushed brass, surrounds and enframes the wooden stack or multiple drawers available in several different finishes. The whole assembly is covered with thin inset solid surface countertop. The extra extended space of the metal frame creates enough space for a floating inset shelf matching the top, and a towel bar. Overall dimensions: W: 48\", D: 21\", H: 16\".",
