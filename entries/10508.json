From 10,000 feet above the earth, a variety of shapes, colors and sizes come together to make an idyllic patchwork quilt-like scene, which directly inspired Fireclay\u2019s designers. <br/><br/>The collection\u2019s eight bold patterns, ranging from linear grids to circular pivots, highlight the dynamic yet structured patchwork of fields, while its three colorways are representative of land use in the region, as well as the elements of nature that are key to agricultural production: the Warm motif pays homage to the earth and soil, the Cool motif the rain, and the White Motif the sun and sky.<br/><br/>The Agrarian collection also represents Fireclay\u2019s commitment to sustainability, environmentally friendly manufacturing processes, and the preservation of Aromas\u2019 natural beauty by using resourced local materials. <br/><br/>These large-format 8x8\u201d tiles are painted by hand with 100% lead-free glazes on a Fireclay's signature Recycled [red] clay body, which is made up of a minimum of 50% recycled products including post-consumer recycled porcelain and glass, as well as pre-consumer recycled granite dust. In addition, the brand recycles their own tile and glaze waste to be re-incorporated into their recycled clay bodies. <br/><br/>The collection's geometric designs are ideal for creating impactful focal points in residential and commercial environments alike \u2013 mix-and-match for a unique tile landscape, or choose a single pattern to create a striking feature installation. <br/><br/>The Agrarian Collection is suitable for both indoor and outdoor use in temperate climates, and for flooring as well as wall surfacing applications. However one chooses to use Agrarian, the collection\u2019s versatile patterns and color motifs offer endless possibilities for self-expression, while simultaneously telling the story of Fireclay Tile and the place that makes its story possible. <br/><br/>For more information and images, please visit: https://www.fireclaytile.com/handpainted/agrarian/.",
