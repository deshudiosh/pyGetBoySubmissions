"description_html": "The SkLO Hold Sconce is a beautiful expression of hand blown glass. A wall-mounted armature of solid brass construction, a simple arm projects from the wall, ending in a circular hook. From this hook hangs the diffuser, an oblong hand blown glass vessel with an integral handle at the top, appearing to drip from the hook, evoking its molten origins as a work of hand blown glass. The arm and hook conceal the electrical wiring - a length of fabric-wrapped electrical cord exits the end of the brass arm, just above the hook. The cord ends in a brass socket, which hangs freely within the glass \"Hold\" diffuser. Each piece of \"Hold\" glass is hand blown in the Czech Republic, without the use of moulds, in the true European artisan glassblowing tradition. No two are exactly alike.<br/><br/>Available in 8 different opaque and transparent glass colors (including clear), and in 2 different metal finishes (brushed brass and dark oxidized brass). <br/><br/>The product submitted is the hard-wired version of the SkLO \"Hold\" Sconce. A plug-in version is also available.<br/><br/>Specs:<br/>120V E26 socket<br/>Dimensions 23\"Hx8\"Wx5\"D<br/><br/>The SkLO Hold Sconce is also available in a UL listed version sized to comply with ADA Accessibility Guidelines and Code Requirements, ready for commercial use in public spaces.",
