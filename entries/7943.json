"description_html": "The Euclid Collection features coopered sculptural furniture. Utilizing the traditional barrel making technique each faceted piece creates a gradual and solid curved surface with grain wrapping details. <br/><br/>Made in solid white oak or ash the Euclid Bench features gently faceted grain matched legs. Each seat is hand woven with solid braid cotton cord which delicately pierces the curved base. The patterning is unique and designed to suit the geometry of each piece. The woven seat is a contemporary take on a traditional practice pulling from danish cord and shaker rush weaving as well as Peruvian and American Indian tapestry weaving.",
