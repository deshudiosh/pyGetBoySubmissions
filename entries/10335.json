"description_html": "Mr T from Materia AB is a unique piece of furniture that makes an impression either on its own or in a group of stools. <br/><br/>Mr T is designed to let you sit in several different ways. It invites users to vary their seating positions. You can sit up straight, on the edge or across the stool. Furnishing with several Mr Ts and positioning them in different directions in the room creates an interesting environment which encourages conversation and interaction. <br/><br/>The stool comes in two heights and can be upholstered in many different fabrics, making it easy to create a varied and interesting environment for both shorter and longer discussions.<br/> <br/>Carcass of steel tubing and plywood with padding of moulded polyurethane foam. Base of steel in chrome alt. dark grey powder coating. <br/><br/>Design: Roger Duverell, Ola Giertz<br/><br/>About Materia: From the outset we have refused to compromise. The combination of innovative design which places the user at centre-stage, and carefully selected materials and manufacturing methods has been a rapid success. Materia was set up in 1992. The combination of innovative design philosophy with focus on the user and being totally uncompromising when selecting materials and manufacturing methods has brought us to where we are today.",
