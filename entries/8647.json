"description_html": "ANN SACKS raises the bar significantly within the decorative tile category with its introduction of Paire, a visually captivating and sophisticated collection that marries the softly honed beauty of stone with the warmth of brass. Depending on the stone and design selected, rooms can be customized to appeal to personal tastes, whether something more understated is desired or a statement-making room is preferred.<br/><br/>Paire is crafted from stone and brass in three distinctive designs. The stone choices are Black Limestone and Verde Marble, their creamy depths differentiated by three patterns of inlaid brass \u2013 Ascend, Strobe and Horizontal. A complementing plain tile completes the choices, serving to juxtapose the decorated versions. Ascend is also offered in a reverse design that when paired, its mirrored patterning produce a dramatic visual effect. <br/><br/>Exclusive to ANN SACKS, Paire comes in 6\u201dx6\u201d and 6\u201dx12\u201d field tiles that are slightly beveled for a finished edge. Additional sizes are offered through special order. Suitable for all interior wall and flooring applications and outdoor applications dependent upon climate and method of installation, it is not recommended for submerged areas. The brass will naturally patina over time but can be brought back to its lustrous glow with simple cleaning.",
