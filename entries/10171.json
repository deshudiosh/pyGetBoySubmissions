"description_html": "REGATTA is sociable, comfortable and designed for smooth sailing. <br/>Suitable for residential, hospitality and commercial applications alike. <br/><br/>REGATTA is Ted\u2019s self-imposed design assignment to explore the core ideas of \u2018the sectional\u2019...bringing people together in comfort. <br/>The resulting curvaceous forms of REGATTA come together to create infinite, scalable configurations. Most pieces are designed to be used individually but are best linked together into a flotilla of comfort. <br/><br/>Each of the thirteen pieces has a gentle arc along its back that aligns with others to create a grand embracing arc and a continuous flow of comfort at every turn. The winged backs align to form apertures while keeping the group open and dynamic from all perspectives.",
