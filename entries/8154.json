"description_html": "Our obsession with weaving found objects into our designs and the play of texture, natural patina, and color, led Rapt Studio to the development of the Exhaust Lounge Chair Collection. Again, as is the case with much of what we do, the juxtaposition of the fabric webbing and furs against the raw steel and wood allowed for a lounge chair that would be at home in many settings, either dressed up or down. <br/><br/>Simple choice allows for the chairs to be used in a public setting or in a private meeting room nestled up to a Tea height table.<br/><br/>The chair is available in raw steel, steel and wood, or powder coat frames with several standard fabric webbing colors. Add fur at your discretion.",
