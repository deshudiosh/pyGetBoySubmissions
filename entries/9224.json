"description_html": "For the first time, Frigidaire is bringing induction cooking to the masses, with ranges and cooktops that are available for less than $1,000. The new Frigidaire FS Induction Range (FFIF3054TS) streamlines, simplifies and quickens the cooking process. The induction technology brings water to a boil 50 percent faster than conventional ovens and heats pans faster so it takes less time to cook. The cooktop cools quickly since the heat is created in the pan itself, meaning it\u2019s far less likely for the cooktop to cause a burn. Induction also allows for much more precise control of heat, with more temperature increments and better performance at very low heat settings for more even results every time. Finally, the technology makes clean-up far less-intensive. Since the cooktop seldom gets very hot, food doesn't burn onto it. This means a splatter, a spill or a pasta-sauce pop calls for a quick swipe of the sponge, not a good, long scrub.",
