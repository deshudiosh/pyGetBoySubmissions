"description_html": "The Hybrid Collection Mesh Pattern on Glass by Mac Stopa for Casali combines the mastery of transparency on glass with Mac Stopa\u2019s 3D Mesh pattern and Casali\u2019s new ink technology, creating a spherical 3D effect on glass with an illusion of morphed movement and a futuristic vibe. When illuminated, the Mesh pattern is projected on adjacent surfaces creating stunning artistic expressions. In addition to bright contrasting colors such as lime green and fuchsia, the Mesh pattern also comes in more subtle nature-inspired earth tones such as sunset orange, olive green, wood bark and sand. Made in Italy.",
