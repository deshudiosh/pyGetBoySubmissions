"description_html": "Inspired by the revival of the arts and crafts movement, the Litze\u2122 Kitchen Collection by Brizo melds artisanal style with clean and contemporary sensibility. A true testament to shape and form, the collection features a strikingly simple bent tube spout on the bridge, pull-down, and bar faucets in three distinct options \u2014Arc, Square and Angled\u2014that can be paired with either the Knurled or Industrial Lever handle. The collection also includes the signature Articulating kitchen faucet, which provides maximum range of motion while making a striking design statement, also available with either handle. Each carefully selected design element\u2014from the range of architectures, to the three spout configurations, to the unique handle options and textured knurling details\u2014ensures this versatile collection feels at home in both modern, minimal environments and urban, industrial spaces.<br/><br/>Making its debut in the kitchen, the stunning Brilliance\u00ae Luxe Gold\u2122 finish is available throughout the collection. An additional Matte Black/Brilliance\u00ae Luxe Gold\u2122 split finish is also available for added drama in the kitchen. Rounding out the finish options are the Polished Chrome, Brilliance\u00ae Stainless and Brilliance\u00ae Polished Nickel finishes.",
