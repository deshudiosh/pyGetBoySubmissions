"description_html": "Complex global issues are requiring people to unlock their creative potential to solve problems at work. Meeting this expectation requires spaces to support collaboration, privacy, focus and rejuvenation. Supporting this range of needs in today\u2019s open environments is challenging and while many organizations have added areas that support collaboration, the demand for enclosed spaces tends to exceed the supply. Additionally, installing these spaces can be disruptive, time-consuming and difficult for workers and workplaces. <br/><br/>To meet the unique spatial needs we are seeing in today\u2019s workplace, Steelcase has added the IRYS pod to our North American portfolio. Developed as a collaborative effort between Clestra Hauserman and HOK Product Design, Steelcase has exclusive rights to offer this product in North America. <br/><br/>The IRYS pod is a freestanding, all-inclusive solution that makes it easy to add enclosed spaces to the open plan. It is ideal for individual focused work or small-group collaborative work and its refined aesthetic allows the pod to seamlessly blend into any existing space. <br/><br/>Each pod incorporates a ceiling, lighting, air treatment and access to power and can accommodate one to three people for either individual focused work or small-group collaborative work. Additional space under the pod\u2019s outer canopy provides a collaborative touchdown area. <br/><br/>Typical solutions for enclosed spaces require connection to the existing building structure. This is not a constraint for the IRYS pod, as it is an autonomous, self-supporting unit. Easy to order and install, the IRYS pod ships in just two weeks and requires only one day for installation, allowing spaces to be quickly transformed to meet the changing needs of today\u2019s workers.",
