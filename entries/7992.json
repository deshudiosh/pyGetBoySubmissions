"description_html": "Naja Utzon Popov's Botanica rug collection for Carl Hansen &amp; S\u00f8n reflects the encounter between Scandinavian and Japanese nature, an inexhaustible treasure trove of shapes, colors, structures, and textures.<br/><br/>The two rugs in the Botanica collection, Midori and Kiri, feature organic, fluid patterns reminiscent of plant life and the soft movements of the traditional Chinese dragon dance. Utzon Popov drew inspiration for the theme from Asia - particularly from Japanese flora. The feminine, spherical rug patterns are beautifully complemented by a more masculine color palette.<br/><br/>The rugs are hand-tufted from wool and sustainable Tencel derived from the fibers of beech tree. Tencel adds a soft, silky finish that elegantly contrasts with the wool's matte look, helping to highlight Utzon Popov's expressive patterns and colors.",
