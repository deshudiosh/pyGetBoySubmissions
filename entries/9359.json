"description_html": "RIPTIDE\u2122 is a modular furniture seating system composed of three primary shapes capable of endless configurations made especially for hospitality and other commercial environments. Seats, and wishbones, and benches, oh my! You can write your name and even draw an outline of a baby Unicorn with it. How cool is that? Once you\u2019ve configured your masterpiece, keep it together with optional ganging plates. And by the Power of Grayskull, you can opt for added USB ports to charge digital devices when using the product indoors. Technically speaking, RIPTIDE is made of one-piece, rotationally molded, specially formulated, high-impact polyethylene with ultraviolet light stabilizers (to reduce fading). The commercial-grade polyethylene material is also FDA-approved, making it ideal for restaurants, food courts and entertainment facilities. It\u2019s also chemically resistant to bleach, salt solution and chlorine solution and its Premium TruColor\u2122 material is fully compounded for superior color and quality assurance. RIPTIDE has enhanced UV resistant formulation suitable for both indoor and outdoor use and is equipped with corrosion-resistant adjustable floor glides. It\u2019s also GREENGUARD and GREENGUARD Gold Certified by UL Environment and is certified for low chemical emissions to UL 2818. UL.COM/GG. This series is part of the inaugural collection from TONIK, a new hospitality furniture brand wrapped around a full blown design statement that pushes beyond boundaries and transforms everyday spaces into funky slices of paradise that connect people. We\u2019re also a designer collective and work with the best and brightest minds, including the uber-cool, industrial design-guru Karim Rashid. Tonik embodies the American spirit: we come from different backgrounds, we relish deep discussions of differing opinions that bring us closer together, we work hard with a can-do attitude, and we care about being good stewards to our next generations. And we do it in comfort and style. So take a trip. Take a dip. Take a sip. The world is a lot more interesting with a splash of TONIK.",
