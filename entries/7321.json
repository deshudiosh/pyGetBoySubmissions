"description_html": "PARQUET, a wink to geometry<br/><br/>Overlaps and visual effects come together in the geometric game of GAN\u2019s new kilim collection, designed by Sweden based firm Front.<br/><br/>Anna Lindgren and Sofia Lagerkvist were able to match traditional flooring patterns and geometries with modern shapes and color, producing tridimensional rugs of irregular shapes. Parquet is harmony with GAN\u2019s philosophy, mixing tradition and novelty, and adding Scandinavian simplicity.<br/><br/>Three different variations: Tetragon, Rhomb and Hexagon were created by the Swedish duo, all of them manufactured in 100% wool on manual looms by our expert craftsmen in India.",
