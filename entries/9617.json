"description_html": "The Ginkgo tree is believed to be the oldest tree species on the planet, a \"living fossil\" if you will, surviving the Ice Age. The graceful fan-shaped leaves are enchanting symbols of peace, hope and longevity and are a favorite motif from the Arts &amp; Crafts movement. The branches of this symbolic tree reached into the minds of the designers at Motawi Tileworks and grew into Motawi's latest installation series, simply named Ginkgo. Motawi's Botanica series is a collection of classical designs inspired by nature. Now blooming at the Tileworks are all of the darling parts of the collection; 4x4 and 2x2 Pansy, 2x2 Fleur, 2x2 Fern and 2x2 Signet, each begging for a starring role in your next Motawi installation.<br/><br/>Motawi Tileworks is a maker of fine American Art Tile, handcrafted with a design aesthetic that is both historically-inspired and often borrowed from the natural world. The company believes that it enriches the world with its beautiful products and healthy business practice. Life at Motawi is lively, positive, cooperative, process-driven and result-oriented. The tiles are created for use in homes, commercial buildings, and public places, and are installed world-wide.",
