Closer to the spectral output of the sun than any other light available. That means balanced, low glare, high contrast illumination with no harsh blue spikes or big dips where you lose color fidelity or visual responsiveness. In fact, OttLite WorkWell LEDs are proven to reduce eyestrain 51% more effectively than the best-selling LED lights. And, everybody knows \u2013 and studies show \u2013 that people who work under natural daylight are more productive and even happier. <br/><br/>Additionally, the OttLite WorkWell LED offers a CRI (color rendering index) of over 95 \u2013 the best available in the market today. <br/><br/>Mid-century modern meets next generation LED technology with the Amplify Desk Lamp. Finished in chrome, this metal lamp is easy to adjust at base, arm and shade so you can position the light exactly where you need it. And, with just the touch of a finger, you can adjust the brightness. Plus, you can quickly and thoroughly charge devices with the 5V, 2.1A USB port to keep the productivity flowing. <br/><br/>The WorkWell by OttLite Series is a health-focused LED technology line that is a continuation of the work of OttLite founder, photobiologist and pioneer in natural light research Dr. John Nash Ott. OttLite was founded in 1989.",
