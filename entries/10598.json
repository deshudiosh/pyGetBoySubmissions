"description_html": "The KOHLER Shagreen Artist Editions bathroom sink is hand-crafted to give the appearance of shagreen leather. This unusual finish, originally inspired by the oil spot glazing that became popular during China\u2019s Song Dynasty, is painstakingly created using an organic two-step mineral glazing process. The result is a sink with a rich, granular texture and velvety iridescence.<br/><br/>Shagreen, or stingray hide, was made popular by 18th Century French aristocrats, and has been used over the centuries on furniture, personal accessories, and book bindings by those who prize its distinctive grainy texture and durable, water-resistant finish. The leather\u2019s exotic appearance and uniquely pebbled patterns have sustained its popularity over the years and made it an enduring mark of luxury and refinement.<br/><br/>Shagreen is available on three different sink designs: the gracefully curved Carillon Wading Pool round vessel bathroom sink, the oval Caxton undermount bathroom sink, and the Carillon Wading Pool rectangular vessel bathroom sink. These Shagreen sinks come in two colors which allude to the finish\u2019s subtle radiance: Ebony Pearl or Oyster Pearl.",
