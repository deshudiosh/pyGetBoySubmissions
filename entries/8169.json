"description_html": "The Fulton Rocker by HBF and MNML re-envisions a traditional classic as a timeless, modern design. Fulton pairs an upholstered lounge of generous proportions with elegant materials to elevate the essential rocking chair, creating a soothing experience in a high-energy collaborative work environment or a quiet room. Fulton brings a much-needed acoustic and visual escape from a busy space with its curved design and quality of materials. With a 21st century interpretation of a rocking chair, HBF is responding to the needs of the ever transformative workplace. <br/><br/>This tranquil piece is gently cushioned in the lower back and seat, offered in both Ash and Walnut, and rests on a tubular metal base. The rocker\u2019s runners are made of solid wood, recalling a rocking chair in its most classic form. The inner and outer shell can be upholstered in the user\u2019s fabric of choice, offering a piece that can feel truly personal. Fulton\u2019s use extends beyond the office; this piece is equally at home in residences as it is in hospitality or commercial spaces. Its inviting shape and gentle motion make it approachable and timeless.",
