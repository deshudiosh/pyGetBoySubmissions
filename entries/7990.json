"description_html": "Based on archetypical shapes, natural materials, and respect for the craftsmanship traditions established by his predecessors, Anker Bak has created a rocking chair that merges the classic with the modern: the Rocking Nest Chair.<br/><br/>Inspired by his sister's need for a comfortable and meditative piece of furniture in which to relax with her newborn baby, the Rocking nest Chair combines wood, leather, canvas, and steel in an organic and inviting shape. While using classic materials, the Rocking Nest Chair challenges the standard rocking chair concept.<br/><br/>Despite its relaxed expression, the Rocking nest Chair demands great precision from craftspeople to ensure that the various materials and all the moving parts interact smoothly. The structure of the chair distinguishes it from traditional rocking chairs, as the soft, stitched leather-canvas shell functions as a load-bearing part of the design. Another unconventional element is the way in which the narrow steel struts are joined to the solid wood framework. It is precisely this delicate interplay between the steel and the wood that causes the chair to appear to float.<br/><br/>The Rocking Nest Chair has been created to suit modern lifestyles, and the ingenious design can easily be folded up and put away. It is available in oak or walnut combined with stainless or powder-coated steel. The seat of the rocking chair is a combination of canvas and leather, with a leather cushion, and the upholstery is held in place by classic flag halyard.",
