"description_html": "Created in collaboration with Pritzker Prize-winning French architect, Jean Nouvel, Bolon by Jean Nouvel is an industrial flooring collection with contemporary style and a strong architectural presence. Patterned with lines of varying thicknesses, Bolon by Jean Nouvel can be laid vertically, horizontally or at a diagonal to windows, emulating sunlight through glass.<br/><br/>A departure from Bolon\u2019s typical designer-driven flooring, the Bolon by Jean Nouvel Collection was conceived with spatiality in mind. The series features a textural, hand-woven effect, in color combinations of black, gray, red and blue. Six styles (No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5 and No. 6) are available in roll format, with two (No. 1 and No. 6) also available in 20\u02dd x 20\u02dd tile format. <br/><br/>Bolon by Jean Nouvel is suitable for a variety of applications, including heavy commercial traffic flooring areas (Durability Class 33) with a 15-year material warranty.<br/><br/>\"The freedom is yours to use the flooring to play with color and light, and engage the windows of the space. It is not a decorative carpet, but an architectural floor.\" - Jean Nouvel<br/><br/>\"I'm a bit of a minimalist, so I enjoy it when the figurative theme disappears and one goes towards the most essential thing: the basis of the texture.\" - Jean Nouvel<br/><br/>Material: woven vinyl",
