"description_html": "The PK1 dining chair, designed by Poul Kj\u00e6rholm in 1955, is an early example of Kj\u00e6rholm's unique ability to combine steel with organic materials. The design has an understated look which requires expert craftsmanship and an in-depth understanding of the inherent nature of the materials.<br/><br/>Kj\u00e6rholm's first dining chair, the PK1 marked the beginning of an impressive career. Despite its clean, minimal expression, the PK1 is a complex chair requiring highly skilled craftsmanship, not least in the weaving of the flag halyard. Kj\u00e6rholm strove to create harmony between form and material, and sought to express the authenticity of materials and perfect crafting process.<br/><br/>Kj\u00e6rholm's PK1 chair comprises a steel frame and a combined flag halyard seat and backrest, which ensures a high degree of comfort and visual lightness suited for a variety of interiors. Available in several different steel variants combined with natural or black flag halyard, the PK1 stack up to five chairs at a time, proving to be both versatile and practical.<br/><br/>The PK1 is also available as an outdoor version with a stainless steel frame and weather-resistant flag halyard.",
