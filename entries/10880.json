"description_html": "Building on a longstanding relationship between acclaimed designer Steven Volpe and McGuire Furniture, the brand's Fall 2016 collection included seating and occasional pieces by the San Francisco designer. Volpe, who grew up with the McGuire family and describes his designs as grounded in the original McGuire aesthetic, introduced bold products crafted using some of the brand\u2019s signature materials and techniques including rattan, rawhide and caning. <br/><br/>Years in the making, the Rumchunder Lounge Chair by Steven Volpe made a dramatic debut. A web of angles create a multi-faceted figure high on style and comfort. Carved oak is enhanced by a cascading back of tightly woven herringbone caning, then topped with a plush seven channel back and seat inspired by pleats of fine Indian silk, as its namesake signifies. Each angle and curve exacting in technique, creates a form that carries interest from every perspective. At 43\" tall, the Rumchunder Lounge is supportive, luxurious and crafted with care. Comes standard in Chestnut finish. Tight upholstery; COM or COL.",
