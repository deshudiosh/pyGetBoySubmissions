"description_html": "Designed by Mac Stopa for Mosaico Digitale, Digital Universe is a 3D pattern on resin tile resembling a 3D map of the universe, whose structure is similar to that of neurons. On their perimeter, the 24 in. by 24 in. tiles have identical geometry ensuring modularity, while the center of each tile is artistically distorted following the organic geometry of the pattern creating randomness. The super light tiles are waterproof, easy to transport and easy to install. They can be used in a variety of both indoor and outdoor applications including office interiors, building lobbies, restaurants, cafeterias, building elevations and swimming pools, to name a few. Thanks to the flexibility of resin, the main component of the mosaic tile, Digital Universe can also be applied on curved walls. Made in Italy.",
