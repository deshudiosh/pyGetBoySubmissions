"description_html": "Dornbracht, the manufacturer of luxury bathroom and kitchen fittings, introduces Vaia. Inspired by transitional style, the distinctive design of the new premium designer fitting is both elegant and progressive. Vaia is equally at home in traditional and modern bathrooms, as well as those that combine elements of eclectic style worlds.<br/><br/>The Vaia series incorporates a soft, balanced design language with an attitude that is receptive to anything new. Its delicate spout features a traditional shape and transposes to a new, open silhouette. There is a traditional feel to the handles as well \u2013 available as cross-handles or levers \u2013 combining geometric shapes and soft contours. The rosettes are tapered, creating an especially smooth transition to the washstand.",
