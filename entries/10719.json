"description_html": "The Lichen Collection by Mohawk Group is a new Red List Free modular plank carpet system resulting from innovations that merge leading concepts in biophilic design and sustainability. Designed by Jason F. McLennan, the founder of the Living Product Challenge (LPC), and his team at McLennan Design, Lichen is the first flooring product to achieve the International Living Future Institute\u2019s LPC Petal Certification. Inspired by the idea of \u201cNature\u2019s Carpet,\u201d the design team looked at natural assemblages of rich multi-hued, multi-textured lichens from extreme climates as the foundation for the collection. Patterns within the collection mimic nature through a large-scale field of lichen \u201cblooms,\u201d a transitional style with fewer blooms, and a textured ground pattern, designed to be used as a system or to individually standalone. <br/><br/>The creation and specifying of Lichen has a net positive impact for people and the environment. Lichen continues to give back through innovations in materials, manufacturing and community involvement, which encompassed the donation of 140 low-flow shower heads to Morehouse College to offset the amount of water used in the collection\u2019s manufacturing. It is truly sustainable, leaving a handprint rather than a footprint. Just as lichens play a regenerative role in their natural ecosystem, the Lichen Collection gives more resources back to the environment than it uses during its entire life cycle.",
