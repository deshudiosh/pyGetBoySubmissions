This modern interpretation of a chandelier has solid acrylic arms which are squarely facetted to ensure an even glow from its integrated LED light source shining from the core. Available in a Satin Nickel or Aged Brass (shown) finish, its dimensions are 31.8\u201d high and 48\u201d in diameter. The integrated LED uses 35.1 watts while delivering 2709 lumens at 3000K, 90 CRI, and is dimmable down to five percent with a compatible ELV dimmer. Photon can also be ordered in the 227-volt version for commercial use. There\u2019s also a smaller Photon 34.",
