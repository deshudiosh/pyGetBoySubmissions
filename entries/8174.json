"description_html": "HBF has partnered with Copenhagen-based design practice OEO Studio to create an elegant and timeless handcrafted furniture collection. The Essens Series of chairs and stools encapsulates the aesthetic of both OEO and HBF: equally timeless as they are modern, equally modern as they are visually stunning. <br/><br/>The Essens collection was built with a high attention to detail and a thoughtful focus on craftsmanship. HBF and OEO\u2019s dedication to natural, quality materials shines throughout all the furniture pieces, with the Essens chairs &amp; stools constructed of solid wood, leather, metal, and quality textiles. HBF\u2019s goal of creating furniture for how people work rather than where people work is reflected in the Essens series flexibility of use \u2013 from the big open office to the meeting room, small office and boardroom as well as more social settings. <br/><br/>The Essens seating series is defined by its rich mix of materials and chic yet minimal design. The simple metal leg of the Essens chair adds contrast and highlights the sculpted solid wood back, which is soft and embracing. The seat and arms are integrated, creating a purposeful focus on the proportion and structure of the chair. The Essens chairs and stools are a perfect harmony of detail, material and ergonomics. The wood seat and back evokes a crafted feeling and quality, adding posture and refinement, while the use of metal adds precision and modernity. <br/><br/>Available in a variety of heights and configurations, including a counter stool, bar stool, and guest chair, the Essens Series provides functional and flexible seating additions to any space.",
