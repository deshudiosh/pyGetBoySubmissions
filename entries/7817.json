"description_html": "Inspired by how people work today, Q6 by Jonathan Prestwich has created an all-inclusive line which addresses the need for different kinds of working spaces. Comprised of open seating, screens, benches, tables, and ottomans, Q6 provides a versatile line of stylish and highly functional pieces.<br/>The Q6 collection of seating keeps the same silhouette of the classic Davis line, Q5, with options for benches with or without backs and additional privacy screens. Giving the option for privacy greatly increases the ability to utilize Q6 in new ways. Bench and ottoman units have added padding and a new seating suspension for even more comfort.<br/>The table collection expands the range of Q6 even further, these power-capable tables are offered in three innovative heights - designed for how people work. Based on the desired use, choose from work, lounge, or individual height tables.<br/>Q6 encourages collaboration in a highly mobile workplace. Supporting casual work, communication, and collaborative group areas, Q6 spaces can serve multiple purposes with versatile applications. Extended configurations can offer private areas in conjunction with open seating, and work or lounge tables for individuals or small groups. Smaller configurations offer booth style seating and small meeting areas, plus ottomans for on-the-spot seating and touch down areas. Seemingly endless configurations allow for limitless possibilities and a broad range of settings with a natural flow of design.<br/>Q6 is a comprehensive line which features all of the necessary components for a truly modern workplace with a beautiful and consistent design vocabulary.",
