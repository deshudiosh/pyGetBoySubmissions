"description_html": "The Wood Float Sofa offers a solid wood frame with an acrylic back and upholstered seat cushions optional. It explores the marriage between structural walnut wood and clear acrylic plastic. With a floating back plane, the piece feels both light and grounded with its modern curving profile. Dimensions: 29\"L X 84\"W X 29\"H; SH 15.25; SD 18.75\" with cushions. There is also a Wood Float Chair. <br/><br/>\"Using my understanding of the manufacturing process in metals, woods, glass and acrylic, I was able to fully detail the product for ease of construction and durability. Many of the commercial manufacturers will not work in acrylic and most who are familiar with acrylic do not know how to work in metals and wood to the high-end degree required by this product. I introduced the best manufacturers of each of the materials and helped them work through any concerns or issues. They now know not to be afraid of acrylic and how amazing it can be.<br/><br/>I have used acrylic for many years and can speak to its durability and strength. It is also innovative in the way it allows customization and fits into smaller spaces as well as a multitude of stylistic environments,\" said acclaimed interior architect Lauren Rottet.<br/><br/>No endangered wood species are used in the collection and there are no infill materials, such as substrates. All the finishes are integral with the composition of the product.",
