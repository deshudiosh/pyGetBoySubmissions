"description_html": "Nora is a contemporary collection that blurs the lines between contract and residential design. This lounge, bench, and table series blends the comforts of home with commercial durability and versatility while its minimalistic design opens the door to a range of material and finish options. Tied together by simple forms, clean lines, and consistent attention to subtle details, the Nora Collection appeals to a sense of timelessness while maintaining a modern edge.<br/>A robust depth of line and universal design aesthetic allows Nora to function well in a range of applications and environments. With one, two, and three seat lounge units and benches, plus tables offered in seven unique sizes, Nora can be used individually or combined to create a variety of communal lounge spaces. Defined by its minimalistic appearance and finely tailored details, Nora can fit in a multitude of interiors.<br/>There is more to Nora than meets the eye \u2013 this seemingly simple line was designed with important details in mind. The generous width of the lounge arm functions as both a working surface and an impromptu seat. Benches can be paired with tables to create long runs of seating and surfaces, and table heights are staggered to allow for nesting.<br/>While Nora\u2019s aesthetic blurs the lines between residential and commercial, the construction and durability meets the highest commercial standards. High traffic applications and frequent use is no problem for Nora\u2019s internal steel frame, down feather back cushions, and solid steel legs. The solid steel table legs can be paired with high-end surface options such as marble, solid wood, back painted glass, and veneer.<br/>Nora\u2019s airy stance is the result of thoughtful engineering. An internal steel frame which ingrates a unique webbed suspension provides high-level comfort without sacrificing visual lightness or compromising durability.",
