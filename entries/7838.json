"description_html": "The idea for this project was to rethink the notion of lobby and airport seating by establishing a new visual language for the category. Airport seating is somewhat cold, institutional, and expected, while other areas of contract and hospitality furniture have over the years taken on softer, more inviting attributes. Ascent is intended to accentuate the soft, organic seat by contrasting it with a monolithic, geometric base. This combination of the \"opposing\" dynamics of lightness and stability brings unexpected whimsy and beauty to a static seating category. <br/><br/>The Ascent system was also designed to consider the needs of its users by incorporating USB charging options for long wait times, while the base simultaneously acts as a table surface. Lastly, because each seat is separately upholstered and attached to the base, specifiers of this system can play an integral role in the design process by creating unique color palette combinations.",
