"description_html": "RANGER<br/> <br/><br/>From the grassy hillsides in Western Europe, an idyllic life lived. Ranger reminds us of when we first fell for leather. A material that is both rugged and refined; one that not only stands the test of time but responds to it. <br/><br/>With Ranger, life becomes art. <br/><br/>It is a full grain leather finished with only aniline dyes and wax. Tumbling the hides burnishes the natural grain structure, which provides great depth to the twelve standard colors, highlighting the true nature of the leather.<br/><br/>12 colors, aniline dyed, European bull hides, full grain, 1.3 - 1.5mm in thickness, 55 to 60 sq. ft. Avg., Greenguard certified.",
