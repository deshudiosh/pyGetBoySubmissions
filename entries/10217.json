"description_html": "Construction: Handmade using bamboo silk engineered specfically for Tufenkian Carpets.<br/><br/>Design story: Canvas Denim was inspired by the craftsmanship involved in creating something as seemingly simple as a pair of blue jeans. Japanese denim is the most painstakingly crafted denim in the world, using natural dyes and specialized weaving processes that requires highly skilled weavers to produce.<br/>James immediately saw the parallels between the creation of Japanese denim and the production of Tibetan carpets, and created a design to pay homage to the decades of knowledge and craftsmanship that built the Japanese denim industry. The deep indigo and bright white mimics the construction of denim, a process which leaves the weft threads undyed and gives each piece a unique pattern.",
