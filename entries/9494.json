"description_html": "Design by duo Doshi &amp; Levien for Moroso, the design draws inspiration from men\u2019s tailored suits: clothes beautifully sewn with a sophisticated taste for materials and details. Modernista has a strictly rectangular shape that allows the eye to explore its delicate forms and exact proportions. The light padding is refined by the use of buttons, which conjure up the idea of dainty quilting as well as creating a delicate, elegant decorative effect. <br/>A sophisticated collection with a classic feel, designed to add understated elegance to settings which require a light touch but without forgoing the beauty of exquisite details. <br/>The collection suitable for both contract and residential settings is comprised of: sofa (different dimensions, armchair, coffee table (the top can be done in leather).",
