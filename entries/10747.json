"description_html": "How to provide ample seating for several people in a small space? With Mell, the new upholstered bench, the riddle is quickly solved. Loose, separate seat cushions and well-upholstered backrests are more reminiscent of a sofa than of a bench (typical association = hard or uncomfortable). The new member of the Mell family has been designed very consistently: as upholstered furniture. The new model is ideal for integration into the open layouts of apartments and even offices: as a cosy meeting place for sitting together, whether for cooking and eating, debating, working or playing. Space is always precious. Today, families or teams are looking for a comfortable seat that does not look plush and fits in well with contemporary architectures. The new upholstered bench meets these requirements with, among other things, filigree substructures made of chrome-plated steel, alternatively lacquered in other lacquer colours. Upholstery covers in fabric and leather.",
