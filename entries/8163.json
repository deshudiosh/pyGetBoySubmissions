"description_html": "The Trullo is modeled after the historic dry-stone huts in Alberobello, Italy. They are semi-private living spaces which are built closely together to create a denser community, but also embracing the sense of privacy. One historical theory accredits their modular design to an elaborate form of tax evasion. The people of Alberobello were able to deconstruct their homes and collapse their settlements temporarily to hide from the high taxes imposed by nobility during and after the Medieval Era. With this narrative in mind, we designed our very own Trullo to be easy to assemble, move and replace promoting the longevity of use. Individual parts can be replaced easily and quickly to restore and repair the unit in the case of damage. <br/><br/> The Trullo features a fully upholstered, thick dual-panel structure to offer privacy and focus in any environment. This innovative design addresses the current need for design flexibility by providing a practical work space solution for the modern open-plan workplace. Companies are easily able to renovate, redesign and reconfigure their space without investing in construction. The spacious, enveloping back minimizes distractions and filters unwanted ambiance to create a secluded refuge. The series is complete with an array of customization options to make this chair as adaptable and versatile as the work space it joins. Among the versatile combination of high-quality textiles, fabrics, and features available are the integrated power / USB sockets. <br/><br/> A plethora of customization options make the Trullo highly adaptable and versatile. The Trullo inspires infinite design possibilities with three basic models: singular, double, and triple seat modules.These chairs can be configured to support individual work, collaborative spaces, and professional environments. Available in designer-inspired two-tone upholstery for maximum customization. This series is guaranteed to satisfy the creativity of today\u2019s most innovative designers.<br/><br/> The Trullo represents a fusion of privacy and collaboration - the perfect reflection of today's modern work space. <br/><br/>ABOUT NIGHTINGALE<br/>Founded in 1928, Nightingale is a leading office seating manufacturing company in <br/>Canada with a growing global presence.
