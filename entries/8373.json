"description_html": "Observing the growing density of cities across the globe, Neri&amp;Hu\u2019s design addresses the increasingly confined living spaces that urban dwellers are confronted with. The Immersion bathtub, inspired by traditional timber bathing vessels used in Japan and China, is deeper than a standard tub and occupies a smaller footprint.<br/><br/>Similar to an onsen hot spring experience, the posture of bathing is more upright rather than reclined, but the added depth allows a full immersion of the entire body for deep relaxation, while also enjoying the steam as it rises off the water surface. The resulting design features minimal lines, maintains elegant proportions and offers a unique and luxurious bathing experience.",
