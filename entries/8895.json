"description_html": "Cassiopeia X Porcelain is a collection of mobile chandeliers that are built to order and are fully customizable. Andrea Claire Studio works closely with interior designers and architects around the world to craft custom light-art that complements any size and type of space. <br/>The glowing cast porcelain \"Polyhedrons\" in this collection use LED technology and are made by hand with specially formulated porcelain slip. ACS has exhaustively tested slip formulas to arrive at the precise color and warmth of translucency Andrea wanted to achieve. The shapes are cast in plaster molds formed from Andrea Claire's signature bamboo Polyhedrons. Because the plaster is very sensitive the porcelain in turn retains traces of the bamboo's texture. Each surface is therefore slightly varied and dynamic. In this work Andrea explores both form and surface, while offering a timeless hand-crafted custom product. <br/>These mobile chandeliers can hang from 1 to 7 stems, and grow from 7 light points to more than 20.<br/>ACS was fortunate to have the first of this collection installed in 2016 in a gorgeous new residence on Martha's Vineyard designed by Robert A. M. Stern. The photo's shown are from that installation and the studio now has several more custom Cassiopeia X Porcelain chandeliers in production.",
