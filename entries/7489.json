"description_html": "Inspired by an admiration of Mid-Century Modern furniture, Theo is constructed with a molded plywood shell and has a smaller footprint allowing it to serve as a lounge or reception chair, or work as a desk or conference chair in the smaller landscape of today\u2019s offices. Theo is well crafted, with an extremely thin veneer shell that is formed in a conical tapered shape, wider at the juncture of the seat and back and narrower at the top and front of the chair. <br/><br/>Theo consists of High-Back, Mid-Back, Guest chairs and an Ottoman. In addition, Theo also includes a collection of tables that are available in lounge chat and magazine table height.",
