"description_html": "The Simple Writing Desk contributes a multi-functional, dynamic, and beautiful piece to any space, from the office to the home. The desk\u2019s aesthetic is honest, clean, and simple, representing the best aspects of HBF and their design partner, OEO Studio. OEO Studio designed the desk to last for generations - not only because of its durability, but also its everlasting design that evades the typical lifespan of trendiness. <br/><br/>The design is international and carries connections to many parts of the world including American Modern and Danish Modern \u2013 with references to Japan. Combining Danish minimalism with American craftsmanship, the Simple Writing Desk offers exceptional quality and functionality that allows for an endlessly creative and personalized piece. Made with solid wood, the Simple Writing Desk is designed to age with grace and become more beautiful with time; a perfect statement for a future heirloom furniture piece. The desk continues to makes a signature statement with its aesthetic contrast between a classic, smooth wood top and modern, sleek metal detailing. <br/><br/>The desks can be arranged individually for a personal space or paired with others for a communal environment, with options to customize the Simple Writing Desk by varying widths and add-ons including dividers, pin boards, and drawers. Ideal for multiple spaces and situations, the Simple Writing Desk transcends boundaries and generations for a truly timeless piece.",
