"description_html": "The in-house designed collection of nine custom axminster patterns utilizes Brintons' High Definition Weave technology, an industry-leading 32-color capability, to achieve unmatched depth and texture. Each Terra-Grit pattern is massive, with the largest reaching a 48-foot-repeat.<br/><br/>Ideal for hospitality, Terra-Grit's huge patterns can fill large public areas like grand ballrooms and convention spaces. The designs can also have sections cut out for smaller, pre-function areas, offering a different, yet cohesive feel for the guest. Each complex design can be down to carpet an entire hotel with each area being completely unique.<br/><br/>As Brintons is the only axminster manufacturer that can weave up to 32 colors, Terra-Grit's color combinations are unexpected, seemingly pushing aside the safe color families that have become commonplace, yet still work together to create layers of dimension. Rather than simply using black to achieve depth, the Brintons team has explored each color value, combining colors from different families. A comparable process to how a painter would render shadows with Ultramarine Blue mixed with Burnt Sienna.<br/><br/>The overall theme of the collection is rooted in the need for authenticity in design: utilizing real hand-made textures and the brushstrokes of an artist's hand, celebrating a design's humble beginnings. Brintons' Global Design Team routinely practices this \"Dirty Hands\" trend movement with creative experiential workshops. The team uses an assortment of random materials and basic artist's pigments to create unusual and original textures for Brintons' carpet designs.",
