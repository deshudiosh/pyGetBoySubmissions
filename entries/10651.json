"description_html": "Luce, a collection of contemporary handmade glass mosaics, uses reflection and refraction of light to create shifts in color and illumination. As light bounces off the tile surface, these semi-opaque mosaics absorb and reflect nuances of the colors around them. Luce breaks barriers in glass mosaic design with four distinctive patterns: Feather, 2-inch Hex, Fin and Clipper. The 12 subtle pastel hues in Pearl and Silk finishes coordinate with today's movement in color.",
