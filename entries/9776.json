"description_html": "In creating the Belmont pendant, designer Brad Ascalon re-envisions the traditional fabric shade lamp with the warmth and preciousness of hand crafted furniture. Belmont's striking, yet reductive form creates a natural canvas for displaying an array of textiles from premium wool to colourful woven fabrics that can be paired with a crafted solid wood armature in white ash, walnut or black-stained ash. Belmont can be hung individually or in clusters. Available in 22\" and 26\u201d models.",
