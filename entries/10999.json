"description_html": "Lilypad represents exactly what its name suggests. The floating leaf of the water lily is culminated by a blooming lotus flower. The Egyptian sky god Horus was often depicted in ancient art sitting on the Egyptian Blue Water Lily. This image inspired the unique combination of an oval table, with a beautiful chair which appears to be a blossom rising above the table. <br/><br/>The Lily Chair takes it cue from the sinuous form of the Lilypad. It features a continuous unbroken line that traces the exterior of the chair which encases a soft circular cushion much like the center of a blooming flower. The chair subtly converges from an open bloom at the top, to a perfect circle at the base.\u201d<br/><br/>Lilypad is 60\u201dW x 33\u201dD and features a lounge chair that incorporates a self-returning swivel mechanism, which rests on a solid American walnut platform. The platform also incorporates a circular insert, which is available in three Silestone colors in subtle suede finishes. The walnut platform can be selected in a number of walnut finish colors and the chair may be specified in Bernhardt Textiles leather and fabrics, or the customer\u2019s own material.<br/><br/>The Lily chair is available on a stationary base or a base with a self-returning swivel mechanism.
