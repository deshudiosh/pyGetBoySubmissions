"description_html": "The past and future come together in the present to create new design advancements, with MAYFAIR. The original inspiration for these luminaries was derived from the French Bouillotte lamps of the 19th century, a sophisticated piece of design comprising one or more candlesticks with a flameproof adjustable metal shade painted reflective white on the inside. These traditional fixtures have been revamped with a highly contemporary style featuring innovative materials, an elegant silhouette and a refined LED light.",
