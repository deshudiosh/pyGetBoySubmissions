"description_html": "Balancing creative design with functional lighting, Time is a creative conjecture of an exploded view inside a timepiece. This stunning chandelier was created for an Alice in Wonderland-themed dinnerscape and is an intricate balance of gears, springs, pins, and rubies. The lights utilize LED chip-on-board (COB) technology, simulating the ruby jewels found in a clock.<br/><br/>When Kalu Interiors approached us about designing a light that would reflect their \u201cdown the rabbit hole\u201d theme we were thrilled. Lead designer Maurice L. Dery thought he could bring this crucial element of their story to \u201clight,\u201d creating unique and functional lighting both practical and fitting for the display. The biggest design challenge was achieving balance while maintaining symmetry. Time is created using aluminum and acrylic materials.<br/><br/>Project specs: Aluminum and COB LEDs, three-foot diameter aluminum, energy-efficient LED illumination. Designed Fall 2016.",
