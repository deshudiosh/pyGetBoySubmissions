"description_html": "The Alabaster Table measures an ample 18' 8\" L x 6' 2\" W x 29\" H and seats 16. It is constructed of an under-lit, alabaster tabletop, its surface delineated with thin metal, patinated bronze accents. The tabletop is edged with a 38-foot band of hammered, black patinated, sand-casted bronze; the legs are also fabricated of the same material. LED lighting is integrated into the alabaster stone tabletop lending it a moon-lit glow and, when the light is activated 'on' via a remote control or through home automation, there is a range of brightness radiating cool or warm illumination.",
