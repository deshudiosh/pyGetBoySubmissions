"description_html": "With no more than fingertips, one can achieve a feeling of weightlessness with the Cope\u0301rnica lamp. As if levitating, it moves through space effortlessly, without friction or resistance. <br/><br/>Circles, semicircles, tubes, and bars of different diameters, materials, and weights...with the combination of these primary elements the Cope\u0301rnica collection constructs geometric sculptures of light, establishing an intimate relationship with space and combining functionality with the beauty of pure lines.<br/><br/>The collection consists of desktop and standing versions that play with counterweights of mixed materials and density, such as steel and aluminum. This design allows one to move the lamp with great precision, providing a wide range of heights, distances, and adjustments to the beam of light to suite one\u2019s taste.<br/><br/>The upright version, a true statement piece, stands almost six feet in height and directly or indirectly illuminates the environment with its tilting head system.<br/><br/>Cope\u0301rnica draws minimalist sculptures in space, as if your room were a canvas, and the carefully selected colors add soft chromatic touches to the ensemble.",
