"description_html": "Elegant design doesn\u2019t need to mean a lack of welcome. In Rowen, designer Brian Graham took inspiration from architecture and landscapes to create a graceful, inviting form that evokes a sense of beauty and peace without sacrificing warmth. People need environments that calm and inspire, and Rowen helps create those spaces. The thin, faceted legs create a sense of lightness and poise, while the softer shapes of the cushions provide comfort.",
