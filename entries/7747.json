"description_html": "The Acrovyn by Design\u00ae pattern collection will transform the way you look at wall protection. Created by professional designers to bring a new feel to CS Acrovyn\u00ae wall protection, these patterns coordinate with our standard colors and can be specified for permanent adhesive panels or demountable wall panels. The collection consists of 13 brand new patterns in a variety of colorways and six new Chameleon\u2122 simulated woodgrain patterns. Inspiration was taken from textiles and organic elements, and customizable options are available.<br/><br/>Unlike current wall covering products on the market promising protection, Acrovyn by Design patterns are embedded behind a .040\" thick rigid sheet, making it the ultimate option in strength and durability. When specified as a wall panel, Acrovyn by Design is installed using our demountable Sure Snap\u00ae System, an innovative mounting concept that cuts installation time in half and makes it easy to clean and maintain your wall protection. <br/><br/>Acrovyn by Design is PVC-free and has been tested in accordance with ASTM E84 Class A/1 fire characteristics. Supplied in 4'x8' or 4'x10' rigid sheets, this wall protection option installs with a heavy-duty, water-based mastic adhesive and utilizes minimal sheet spacing, caulk or trims to allow for proper expansion and contraction of the material. We provide up-to-date product data, installation and maintenance instructions, sustainability records, testing information and other documentation for your peace of mind.",
