"description_html": "SIXINCH presents a unique line of chairs and tables called Tauko. Designed by Mac Stopa, the Tauko collection is inspired by designs from the 1950s and 1960s that perfectly match the home office design trend. <br/><br/>The collection is characterized by soft, aesthetically pleasing organic shapes and high-quality wooden elements. The wide palette of finishes, including natural wood, laminate and range of upholsteries envelope color concepts that harmonize with the new color trends - making the Tauko Stool an ideal solution for office and hospitality spaces. <br/><br/>The stool has a unique seat that consists of two halves fastened together at the bottom, producing an interesting visual effect. Full seating comfort is ensured by the well-contoured line of the chair bucket. The Tauko Stool is an excellent fit for office meeting rooms, cafeterias, hotel bars, cafes/restaurants, as well as for public spaces, including office lobbies and airport waiting areas.",
