All of our illuminated basins are created using high density \u00bd\u201d resin Aura stone. This material is highly resistant to scratches or etching and extremely easy to clean and maintain. Aura stone is a translucent material allowing our energy efficient LED lighting arrays to disperse light throughout the entire product; creating an atmosphere-setting icy glow in any private bar setting for a truly unique experience. Customize your experience with the remote control included with your purchase and tailor the lighting to your personality; whether you enjoy a peaceful solid hue, or a flashy strobe or every colour in the rainbow, the illuminated basins can deliver.<br/><br/>Our custom illuminated basins are tailored to your unique needs.
