"description_html": "Ed Ng and Terence Ngan of AB Concept\u2019s collection with Lasvit unveils FLUX, where glass meets metal as light meets water. The FLUX collection is an extension to the mood of light reflecting off of waves in different angles.<br/><br/>With the Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong as the backdrop to Mr. Ng and Mr. Ngan\u2019s youth, the inspiration for this collection comes from the beaming light reflections emitted by the waves. The convergence of opposing elements on the FLUX light fixtures allow light to delicately illuminate a space, interacting with each other in different spatial environments. <br/><br/>FLUX is not meant to illuminate a room entirely, as it is intended to set a tone to one\u2019s visual and learning experience. It is bright enough for one to be able to navigate through a space, but dim enough to discover other senses beyond the eyes. While the wavy appearance on the glass evokes ambiguity, the double-sided metal base adds sophistication. The symphony of light that is transmitted from the contrasting materials creates a pleasurable experience.<br/><br/>In celebration of Mr. Ng and Mr. Ngan\u2019s adolescence illuminated by the glistening light reflections from Victoria Harbour\u2019s waves, the FLUX collection epitomises warmth and memories.",
