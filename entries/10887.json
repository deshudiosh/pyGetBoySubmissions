"description_html": "The artisanal weave of the Arteriors Elis Bench is refashioned as a table lamp, interlacing gray suede over a minimal solid brass frame. A combination of equestrian-inspired handwork and pure geometry, its juxtaposition of materials layer warmth and texture over modern polish. Topped with a rectangular ivory microfiber shade that is lined in gold foil. Designed by Windsor Smith as part of her Windsor Smith for Arteriors collection.",
