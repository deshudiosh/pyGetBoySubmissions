"description_html": "The Cassidy table strikes a chord with its simplicity of form yet pays close attention to precise details, resulting in a complex and memorably distinctive design. Cassidy\u2019s classic aesthetic combines tapered legs with a slight geometric shape that seamlessly blends into the walnut top. The table top is constructed with a subtle curved shape, creating an engaging design that enhances the visual appeal when used in a more linear setting. Cassidy is available in two sizes and shapes. A rectangular table with a flat cut walnut veneer surface measures ninety inches long and forty inches wide. A circular table forty-eight inches in diameter has a unique walnut reverse diamond pattern on the top.",
