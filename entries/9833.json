"description_html": "In 1955, American visionary, Frank Lloyd Wright created a line of fabrics for Schumacher that took the world by storm. Today, we are bringing back many of the beloved original patterns as well as some new ones based on Mr. Wright\u2019s sketches and drawings, in collaboration with The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. Perfect for modern spaces and still as exciting as they were when they were launched, they are available in various color stories so they can easily be used together. Applied Architecture, as it is aptly called, is a testament to the genius of Frank Lloyd Wright.",
