"description_html": "Resembling the glossy bark of rain-soaked Aspens in the Cathedral region of the Colorado mountains, Hartmann&amp;Forbes\u2019 new innovative natural wallcovering design is created with hand-sliced cork skillfully placed on metallic backing paper, then printed with a design inspired by winter woodlands. This meticulous process results in a lasting, timeless design complementing any interior space and reflects the personality of the region that inspired its creation.<br/><br/>\u201cWe were excited about the wallcovering; under normal scenarios, it would be a beautiful background but we featured it as a piece of art. It anchors the master bedroom so everything else in comparison is very simple. The impact as you walk in, when you see the texture and sparkle, the beautiful subtleties that come through, it rewards the person looking at it from afar. You see a warmer texture but as you come close you see its character emerge \u2013 we like that subtly, we like that play in scale \u2013 we love the richness of it all.\u201d <br/>\u2013 Balazs Bognar, Director at Kengo Kuma and Associates <br/>Referring to the Cathedral wallcovering featured in the master bedroom of the Suteki House at the 2017 NW Natural Street of Dreams",
