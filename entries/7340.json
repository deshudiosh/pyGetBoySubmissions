"description_html": "The work of artist Shantell Martin is a meditation of lines; a language of characters, creatures and messages<br/>that invite her viewers to share a role in her creative process. Part autobiographical and part dreamlike whimsy,<br/>Martin has created her own world that bridges fine art, commercial and the everyday experience \u2014 conversations,<br/>objects and places. Known for drawing on anything she comes across from walls to shoes to herself, Martin has<br/>amassed an impressive body of work and turned the art world upside down.<br/>In an exciting new collaboration, Shantell Martin and the Momentum Design Studio worked together<br/>translating her drawings, thoughts and musings into four textiles designed to enliven and excite corporate<br/>interiors. The designs are unique yet unified by a connecting story; a series of conversations between the<br/>elements, places and internal questions of her life and of our own.",
