"description_html": "Designed by Royal Botania Co-Founder and engineer Kris Van Puyvelde, the Palma is the first ever-automatic garden umbrella. A combination of technical ingenuity, engineering and exceptional design, the product\u2019s effortless streamlined style is a charming nod to the classic South of France resort umbrella. Opening up a garden umbrella is currently more complicated than it needs to be. With the launch of Palma, Royal Botania is revolutionizing the category. Providing the most convenient operation possible, the base contains a quick-release mechanism and the aluminum shaft encloses a gas strut. The mechanism does the rest, raising it to a fully open position. By pulling down on one of the arms, the umbrella can be retracted in just the same way. Because its mechanics are contained within the contours of the design, the Palma has a sleek silhouette. All of the mechanical cleverness is hidden within.<br/><br/>The canopy textile is made of Sunbrella, UV and water resistant fabric and is available in eight colors: White, Cappuccino, Black, Mocca Basic, Rock Basic, Aqua Basic, Lime Basic, and Violet Basic. The powder coated aluminum pole, ribs and base are available in White, Cappuccino or Black. The pole is powder coated aluminum.",
