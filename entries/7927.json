"description_html": "Industry leaders Samad (www.samad.com) continue to wow with the launch of their bold new Shibori Rug Collection. The inspiration for this line comes from the ancient Japanese dyeing technique of Shibori, best identified by its fluid assortment of soft blurry-edged shapes. These tie-dye designs are crafted with high-quality wool, which is dyed by hand to deep saturated indigo hues that evoke the ocean and feelings of tranquility. Due to their unique pattern and rich blue color palette, these versatile carpets can easily be incorporated into a number of contemporary interiors or function as a standout piece within a room. As with all things handmade, each rug varies slightly in tone and style, further adding to the unique personality indicative of the traditional Shibori textiles.",
