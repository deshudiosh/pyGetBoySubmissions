"description_html": "HBF has collaborated with Studio Gorm to create the elegant and authentic Studio Table. The standing height table features an open, honest design that provides a practical solution to the 21st century work environment. With curated materials and thoughtful design elements at its forefront, the Studio Table finds beauty in utility.<br/><br/>The collection is intuitive to use and enjoy, and the table\u2019s aesthetics make it a standout: while the tabletop is rectangular, a secondary shelf has curved edges for an eye-catching and inviting juxtaposition. The tabletop also features a split down the center that adds both a beautiful design element and gives users an easy and discreet place to easily access power. The Studio Table\u2019s triangular leg detail gives the otherwise solid piece a sense of airiness, and its solid wood construction makes it immediately elegant.<br/><br/>The Studio Table is at standing height to allow for informal standing meetings or laptopping, but it can also be paired with stools for dining or longer work sessions. Its design is open while still providing all the necessities: the power rests on the second, lower shelf, where users can also store bags or other items. The Studio Table\u2019s versatility extends beyond the traditional office. It is at home in workspaces, conference and meeting rooms, cafes, lounges, hospitality settings, and even residential kitchen settings.",
