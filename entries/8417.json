"description_html": "Winner of the Iconic Award 2016\u2019s prestigious \u2018Best of Best\u2019 prize in the outdoor category, MBRACE by Sebastian Herkner takes a joyfully unconventional approach to lounge furniture. Combining a teak base with wrap-around woven-fiber seating, the collection practically cocoons its users in luxurious comfort. And now, this winning approach has been extended to the MBRACE daybed, an iconic new addition to what is quickly becoming a signature DEDON collection.<br/><br/>Visually, the daybed has all of the characteristics that make MBRACE such a hit, from the eye-catching organic curves to the understated Nordic elegance of the solid teak base to the mesh-like triaxial weave in three rich and distinctive color ways, Atlantic, Pepper and Spice. But what really marks this daybed as a member of the MBRACE family is the sense of comfort \u2014 warm, welcoming, embracing \u2014 that one feels when sinking into it.",
