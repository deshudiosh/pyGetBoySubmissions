"description_html": "Hashtag is a fun, extremely large-scaled and bold contemporary design, made up of crisscrossed lines, inspired by the \u201cHashTag\u201d symbol, hence the name\u2026Hashtag! This is a three color design and incorporates both metallic and flat inks to bring dimension to the wall in a striking application.<br/>The background linen texture is an extremely convincing replication of a crisp woven linen textile, reminiscent of a natural panel cloth. <br/>HashTag is offered in a range of twelve colorations, spanning the gamut from light, understated neutral tones, to bold, deep, and rich accent colors. The color reference and inspiration is taken from some of the newest Arc|Com upholstery designs that are being released, reflecting these unique, modern, trend-setting color combinations. HashTag is a 20 ounce vinyl, on a Non-Woven eco-Backing.",
