"description_html": "The Offset Ring System is a practice in the exploration of form, offering an innovative solution to the challenge of scale on both vertical and horizontal planes. Expanding the potential of the Suspenders System, Offset Rings features Suspenders Power Bar Rings suspended from each other in asymmetrically offset, interesting patterns. The configuration possibilities extend scale across larger spaces with sweeping sculptural interest. The suspended cylinder combines glass-lensed diffused and directional downlight luminaires. The three-ring offset linear composition provides a balanced approach to lighting a surface dominated area. <br/><br/>Ladder Lights were created as the SONNEMAN team built out configurations that added scale in height and depth. They saw the voids between the layers of configurations and imagined the possibility of lights filling these voids. Their team explored a what-if possibility by adding lights that could snap onto the existing Hanger structures. It turned out to be an engineering and design challenge, but it was worth the effort to develop a totally new and fascinating dimension to lighting with Suspenders that added simple yet dramatic illumination.",
