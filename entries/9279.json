Dura Supreme's Personal Paint Match Program offers the entire Sherwin-William\u2019s paint palette, over 1,500 colors, for your new kitchen or bath cabinetry. Color is a highly personal preference for most people and although there are specific colors that are considered \u201con trend\u201d or fashionable, color choices should ultimately be based on what appeals to you personally.<br/><br/>The new Curated Color Collection addition to the Personal Paint Match Program will be updated annually as color trends shift. This offering of colors will always be fresh and current, and reflective of popular color trends for home interiors and cabinetry. These 6 colors are available under the Personal Paint Match program and pricing, and can be designed and ordered without creating a color match (or paying the development fee) each time, adding additional cost savings. <br/><br/>The six colors released for 2017\u2019s first release of the Curated Color Collection include Gale Force (SW 7605), Jasper (SW 6216), Cyberspace (SW 7076), Lemon Meringue (SW 7561), Slate Tile (SW 7624), and Attitude Gray (SW 7060).
