"description_html": "The collection called Blue Azzurro will consist of three patterns -Acuto, Triangoli, and Striato \u2013 and brings an architectural, geometric-inspired element to the table. Each unique piece was designed to reflect the majolica style of Italian tiles and pottery. The collection blends various shades of blue and is accentuated with touches of micro-safe gold. Blue Azzuro is a mix and match of casual geometrics crafted from hand painted designs offered in an array of dinnerware and accessories.<br/><br/>\u201cBecause of the freshness of the designs and the collection\u2019s overall versatility, I feel that this will be a terrific new addition to the tabletop market. I designed the collection to allow endless opportunities for mix and match table settings.\u201d said Luca Andrisani. He notes that \u201cthe intentional smudges and brush strokes seen throughout the collection are intended to give each piece a hand-crafted quality like the coveted pottery produced in Vietri Sul Mare, a town near Salerno, Italy.\u201d",
