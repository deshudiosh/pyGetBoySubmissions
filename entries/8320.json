"description_html": "Like the subatomic particle it was named for, Electron is an elegant and modern light fixture radiating attractive energy into its environment. Demonstrating resourceful engineering without compromising beauty or functionality, the double-sided lighting maximizes illumination while the LED technology maximizes energy efficiency. The single pendant has a pleasing colour temperature of 3000K and no electrical wires. <br/><br/>Part of a lighting series that has been in development since December 2015, the Electron pendant design is deceptively simple. On the front surface there are no visible fasteners, allowing for a clean and refined finish. Suspended from a co-axial cable, the Electron offers a clean suspended appearance. <br/> <br/>This modern pendant is refined and futuristic. Each Electron was designed, developed, and manufactured by Karice Enterprises Ltd.<br/><br/>Project specs: Outside diameter 9 7/8\u201d, inside diameter 6 1/8\u201d, 1\u201d thick, 856 lumens, 12 volt, dimmable LED.<br/><br/>Finishes available: Brasslike light gold, silver or black.",
