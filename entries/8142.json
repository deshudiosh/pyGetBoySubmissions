"description_html": "Description<br/>Electra Grande is a series of glazed porcelain tile with printing applications and a unique geometric appearance. The collection is inspired by encaustic cement tile and has a slightly patinaed look, rather than having consistent, bold coloring throughout each piece. Tiles are oversized hexagons (approximately 13.5\u201d X 15.5\") with lines projecting across the surface. Once the material is installed, the lines create a geometric pattern of their own. Tiles can be installed to form various patterns for floor and wall.<br/><br/>Colors, Finishes &amp; Sizes<br/>Electra Grande is available in four colors (Lightning, Neptune, Mercury and Midnight), in a Matte finish in a thickness of 9mm in the following nominal size: 13.5\u201d X 15.5\"<br/>Tiles are not rectified and not mono-caliber.<br/><br/>Applications<br/>Electra Grande is suitable for interior and exterior walls and interior floors, including heavy-traffic commercial flooring applications.",
