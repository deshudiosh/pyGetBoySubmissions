"description_html": "Layering dense wool felt over sustainable cork, Submaterial wallcoverings are designed to delight the eyes, celebrate natural materials and soften harsh acoustics. Each handmade section engages the senses with its color and craftsmanship, combining seamlessly to create a must-touch dimensional surface. With more than 60 available color choices, our wallcoverings can be specified from soothing monochrome neutrals to striking graphic statements. <br/><br/>Submaterial wallcovering patterns emphasize simple and easy forms that - depending on colorway - can fade visually to the background or leap forward to dominate a feature wall. The Index series works with relationships of rectangles and linear forms, with the patterns finding a randomness and pleasing equilibrium. Our Figure series features repeating organic and geometric forms that are scaled large for whole-room impact. <br/> <br/>Our wallcovering designs are tile-based and modular, made-to-order according to each client\u2019s specified colorway. We\u2019ve created digital tools that simplify color layout and waste calculation, and our clear instructions make for an easy installation.",
