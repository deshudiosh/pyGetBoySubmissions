"description_html": "The result of a unique partnership between designer Mark Goetz and PostureFit\u00ae inventor and longtime Herman Miller seating advisor Dr. Brock Walker, the Taper Chair delivers a high-touch, high-comfort, high-performance experience, raising the bar for performance in executive seating. The chair was developed for Geiger.<br/><br/>\u201cI wanted to design an incredibly comfortable chair that gives the personal fit of a custom-tailored suit, the support of the finest ergonomic chair, and the quality feel of a high-performance automobile seat,\u201d says Goetz.<br/><br/>Dr. Walker is a former competitive skier and a specialist in design for human performance. His proprietary MEARS technology was developed to identify what the human body needs to be strong and comfortable, and then help a designer translate those needs into design requirements for seating that empowers the person sitting in the chair.<br/><br/>Every contour of Taper has a purpose. The complex contouring of the upholstered backrest focuses support in areas of the back that are important for musculoskeletal balance: the sacrum, or base of the spine, and the transition between the lumbar and thoracic spine. <br/><br/>By supporting these key areas, the chair\u2019s backrest design encourages seated individuals to assume a more powerful seated posture: hips rotated forward, spine curved in a natural S-shape, chest open, shoulders back. <br/><br/>The seat of the Taper Chair uses an innovative suspension construction that adapts to the pelvis, so a person feels comfortably supported from the moment they sit down. While executive chairs traditionally feature padding, Goetz took Taper in the opposite direction. \u201cThe closer that we get to the human body and the needs of the human body, the less material we need to use,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole way we achieved comfort in this chair is to get very close to the human body, to the point where you can actually see evidence of where your body belongs,\u201d in the chair. <br/><br/>The chair\u2019s tilt\u2014a modified version of Herman Miller\u2019s most advanced tilt mechanism\u2014delivers a balanced, controlled ride throughout the chair\u2019s full range of recline.<br/><br/>It\u2019s this seamless merger of design for human performance with Geiger\u2019s core strength in quality construction and craft that makes the Taper Chair truly unique among executive chairs.",
