"description_html": "Perennials has introduced a completely new breed of Perennials Luxury Performance Rugs. The new Drop Stitch construction combines the subtle blends of flatwovens with a low hand-knotted pile for a unique, textural experience, appearing in new Maze Craze, Off the Grid, and Smoke Screen. Three new Flatwoven patterns, inspired by the geometrics of classic Scandinavian designs, are Kaleidoscope, Pinwheel and Hopscotch. <br/><br/>As with all Perennials Luxury Performance Rugs, the Fall 2017 collection is handwoven with Perennials 100% solution-dyed acrylic so every dog can have his day without worrying about stains, mildew or fading.<br/><br/>Woven from fine 100% solution-dyed acrylic yarn, these fade-, mildew- and UV-resistant fabrics and rugs are able to brilliantly stand up to life's everyday adventures without sacrificing great design, making them uniquely suited to fit beautifully with any indoor or outdoor aesthetic. They are also bleach cleanable and easily maintained. Perennials fabrics are finished with Perennials' Nano Seal\u2122 for extra protection against the elements. More than just a coating, Perennials' Nano Seal\u2122 is molecularly bonded with the fibers providing long-lasting protection even after repeated washings. All Perennials fabrics are independently tested and certified in accordance with industry standards, measuring resistance to UV radiation, tearing and abrasion.",
