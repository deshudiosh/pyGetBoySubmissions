"description_html": "Sossego is the exclusive US distributor of Brazilian designer Aristeu Pires. Following a long and eminently successful career in computer engineering, Aristeu discovered his passion and exceptional talent for creating modern furnishings from warm Brazilian woods. For 15 years his designs have brought everyday comfort to the finest hotels, restaurants and workspaces across South America where contemporaries in the A+D community have dubbed him \u201cKing of Chairs.\u201d It\u2019s all about exceptional styling: comfort for the body and beauty to the eye.<br/><br/>Olivia armchair<br/>Visually striking, the Olivia armchair\u2019s seemingly delicate, branch-like legs belie her inner strength. The wide seat ensures an easy and comfortable hours-long sit. A trend-setter, her caned back is an exquisite touch.<br/> <br/>Individually hand finished, her arms are carved like a supple fold of a palm leaf falling over. 5 axis CNC machining paired with old world craftsmanship create Olivia's seamless joinery and tactile appeal. Crafted from sustainably harvested jequitib\u00e1 and louro freij\u00f3 hardwoods, and upholstered in natural Brazilian leather, COM/COL, or over 100 fabric options. Jequitib\u00e1 is a sustainably harvested Brazilian hardwood (akin to fine maple or royal mahogany) that features a natural luster and clear grain structure. Louro freij\u00f3 is referred to as \u201cBrazilian walnut\u201d for its rich grain and is sustainably harvested with strict oversight by Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Environment.<br/>Available in 14 wood finishes to grace the home, office, boutique hotels or lobbies. <br/><br/>\"I love the Olivia. For her design, I was inspired by the intertwining branches of an olive tree and incorporated a hint of Art Nouveau,\u201d said Aristeu Pires.<br/><br/>30.7\" H 23.6\" W 22.8\" D 18.7\" SH",
