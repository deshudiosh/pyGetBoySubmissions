"description_html": "FLOX is a modular, flexible acoustical partition that combines a fluid design with the functional need to absorb sound and reduce airborne toxins in the workplace. With a NRC value of .65, FLOX absorbs a wide range of sounds typical in the open office environment. FLOX features a natural wool felt surface that reduces airborne toxins typically produced from off-gassing of adhesives, paints and other manufactured products that may contain formaldehydes. Multiple sections can link together to create any desired length or shape without the use of a tool. The freestanding panels are supported by a steel base plate. FLOX\u2019s panel surface is 100% wool felt finish with a poly-fiber interior for sound absorption.",
