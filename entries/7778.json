"description_html": "Mies van der Rohe\u2019s well-worn quote, \u201cGod is in the details,\u201d aptly captures the sensibility of the polished and urbane Tokyo Console. A closer look at this deceptively simple piece reveals its defined leg structure, floating top with solid edge, and precise interior fittings.
