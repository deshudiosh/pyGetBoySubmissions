"description_html": "The Next collection was designed to respond to the requirements of projects that cover large areas. <br/>The collection defines the digital printing carpet production technique and transfers it to the dynamic and unique style of the most loved pieces of the G.T. Design collections. The textures and designs of their collections (such as Luoghi, Acqua Tinta, and many others), are now available in the technical version for large expanses of flooring and also as simple pieces. The Next collection lends itself to customization and it's the perfect accessory at the service of architects and interior designers. The polyamide technical yarns to apply the print are guaranteed and certified according to the international norms in governing their use in contact sectors and public amenities.<br/><br/>G.T. Design, created for Deanna Comellini, designer and art director, and Michele Preti, are currently celebrating 40 years of activity and has always been a known for their pioneering processes.<br/><br/>Available in the US at Dom Interiors - dominteriors.com",
