"description_html": "This year, Thermador introduced the innovative new Liberty\u2122 Induction Cooktop which offers greater control, flexibility and performance in the kitchen. The cooktop features 11 oval inductors divided into 3 cooking zones, each zone can accommodate pots and pans from 3\u201d to 11\u201d, as well as teppanyaki grills that can measure up to 16\u201d.<br/><br/>The cooktop offers several features to take cooking and entertaining to the next level. These features include: HeatShift\u2122 to increase the power level of the cooktop as a pot is moved from one spot to another, MoveMode\u2122 to enable cooks to easily move pots and pans around the surface by automatically transferring cooking settings to the new location, PanBoost\u2122 to provide a shorter heat-up time when cooking with oil, CookSmart\u2122 to ensure optimal results with five pre-set temperatures, and Stopwatch Function Timer that assists in counting up rather than down. As many chefs have come to expect from Thermador, this cooktop features an exceptional design aesthetic and cleaning is easier than ever before due to a new beveled glass design, as the glass cooktop sits on top of a stainless steel frame.",
