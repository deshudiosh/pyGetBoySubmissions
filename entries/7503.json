"description_html": "The legendary Marcel Wanders has partnered with powerhouse architectural metal design studio PURE + FREEFORM to release The Chameleon Collection, a series of eight new metal exterior finishes that represent a new vision for the future of architecturally expressive exteriors. The collection explores how building facades can transform through changes in light, reflection, vantage point and movement. <br/><br/>The collection is comprised of four types of skins: Sensitive, Dynamic, Romantic and Luxurious. Designed with organic forms, the Romantic Skins are based on lacy patterns and graceful details. Accented by feminine colors, these skins emit a pearlescent shine that transforms throughout the day. Luxurious Skins offer a sophisticated opulence anchored in a palette of black matte and gold. With exquisite detail, they allow a building's exterior to stand out and make a bold statement. The Dynamic Skins use edgy, geometric forms and masculine colors to create high-contrast designs that result in the creation of abstract details and gives a building\u2019s exterior an energizing effect. Delicate details and soft tones are the essence of the Sensitive Skin, with shimmering lights blending with open shapes, to portray a fragile, yet inviting, ambiance.",
