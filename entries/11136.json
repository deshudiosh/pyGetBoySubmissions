"description_html": "Anna Maria Mannarino designed a collection of tables that mimic draped tables. The first set was a grouping of three small cocktail tables in varying sizes. Kabuni/Print-the-Future fabricated the larger of the small cocktail tables first, in a slightly textured, shimmer white. That piece became Case Study #1 for the Kabuni/Print-the-Future company. The expanded collection includes stackable options, including a bar-height size, perfect for event venues, outdoor spaces or lounges. The pieces can be made in many opaque colors, as well as a translucent, glass-like options.",
