"description_html": "Homestead Collection<br/>The form is familiar, but the approach is new. Constructed of solid pine, the Homestead vanity combines classic lines with a warm, Windswept Pine finish. It\u2019s a fresh, country look with an earthy vibe. Decorative, dark escutcheon-like details on door fronts add definition to the pewter knobs. Never losing its classical foothold, the design steps into the present with a new, country chic attitude that could easily work in an industrial loft or suburban farmhouse.",
