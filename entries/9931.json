"description_html": "A collaboration between Riva 1920 and Lamborghini, the Authentic Living collection is composed of a desk, a bookshelf, a chair, a coffee table, and a sofa and is characterized by sinuous and stylish shapes. Each piece is noteworthy due to fine workmanship and the quality of natural and genuine materials, such as solid walnut and black cowhide leather.<br/><br/>Each element stands out thanks to an extraordinary attention to detail displaying the skill of handicrafts, such as the drawers assembled with dovetail joints, the curved panels carved out of solid wood, the cowhide leather cover, and finishes based on natural oil and wax.<br/><br/>Using tradition, innovation, and excellence as inspiration, the distinctive design philosophy embodied by Authentic Living merges the worlds of Riva 1920 and Lamborghini into one seamless expression.",
