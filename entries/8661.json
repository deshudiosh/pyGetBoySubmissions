"description_html": "BIOTIC &amp; PROGRESSIVE<br/>The Voronoi Ceiling System is a drop ceiling product series designed in partnership with MNML that transforms interiors through both cutting edge aesthetics and acoustical performance. Made to magnetically snap to the underside of a tee grid, Voronoi can be attached directly under preexisting tiles while also obscuring the tee grid itself; this is where collaboration yields brilliance. The tessellating pattern offers a stimulating experience, while also enhancing the feel of a space.",
