"description_html": "Lineate is an ERT (enhanced resilient tile) collection from Mohawk Group that is inspired by two of the hottest trends in surface visuals: ombr\u00e9/gradient and striated textile looks. Cool and warm neutrals are combined with on-trend color pops and a linear texture. The color ebbs and flows across the plank to give the illusion of depth on a flat surface. The collection\u2019s loose lay construction allows for quick installation and immediate occupancy. The product\u2019s 5.0 mm and 20 mil construction is twice as thick as standard LVT and transitions easily with carpet tile. An inherent acoustical inner layer construction eliminates the need for underlayment, which reduces cost and installation time.",
