"description_html": "View is an evolutionary step in Glassboards \u2013 combining two of the most common tools in meeting or training rooms into a single solution. View boasts a projector-friendly surface that reduces glare for ultimate clarity and cinema-quality picture. To create the world\u2019s first high-definition glass projection screen, we designed and patented a\u00a0Micro Air-Gap Technology\u00a0that diverts errant light.<br/><br/>View mounts flush against the wall with TruMount multi-directional, concealed hardware and does not require users to have reinforced walls. Write on live screens or simply have an elegant glass surface to project your media. Multiple uses into one, seamless solution. Presentations will never be the same!",
