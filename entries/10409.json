"description_html": "Deeply rooted in the philosophy that argues for the inextricability of good design and extraordinary workmanship, Skram Furniture\u2019s newest fixture, the Torpedo Sconce, is the latest of their products to earn recognition for its singular marriage of austerity, timelessness, and uncompromising technical mastery. The inspiration for the product came from antique levels that sit on the desk of Skram\u2019s founder and lead product designer, Jacob Marks. One in particular, called a 'torpedo' level because of its shape, caught his eye and thus inspired the development of this wall sconce.<br/><br/>Torpedo is an LED driven wall-mounted fixture developed by Marks. The main body features a bronze composition while the end cap and hang bar\u2013with joinery that references the traditional woodworking that defines Skram\u2019s products\u2013are gunmetal steel. Light emanates from slots on the front and sides, and the rear is fully machined-out and diffused, resulting in a soft illumination of the wall.",
