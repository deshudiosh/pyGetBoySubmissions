"description_html": "Wolf-Gordon\u2019s new upholstery textile, Infinite Neutral, challenges the namesake color\u2019s traditional interpretation. Harmonizing with all environments, these dynamic neutrals are composed of a balance of primaries, which allow them to enhance colors in the surrounding environment. The designer, Morgan Bajardi, was inspired by her education in oil painting and color theory when creating the construction. Infinite neutral is multi-dimensional, luminous and complementary.<br/><br/>\u201cDuring art school, I wove rainbow threads together and I was surprised to discover a beautiful gray neutral. I\u2019ve wanted to replicate that concept in an upholstery fabric ever since I started designing textiles. This is the perfect versatile color that will work anywhere.\u201d \u2013 Morgan Bajardi, Textile Designer<br/><br/>To create this ultimate neutral, Bajardi used a crisp crepe weave and combined an innovative mix of variations on the primaries; the results are a complex gray and beige that are both brighter and richer than any conventional neutral mixture. The four colorways are a balance of warm and cool, each containing 30 different thread colors that create subtle striations to catch the eye up close while their individual shades produce layers of depth perceptible at any distance.",
