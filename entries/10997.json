"description_html": "Canelle is a lounge chair destined to be the focal point of any modern space. The design accentuates an elongated slender back and gently sloping arms, evoking a visually intriguing silhouette with beautifully tapered lines. Intricate saddle stitching on both the interior and exterior of the shell paired with top stitching around the perimeter provide beautifully crafted detailing. A sculptured cast aluminum base features a self-returning swivel, which supports the generously proportioned seat, allowing for subtle movement and enhanced comfort. Canelle can be specified in any fabric or leather from Bernhardt Textiles or the customer\u2019s own material. The bases are available in polished aluminum or a black powdercoat finish.",
