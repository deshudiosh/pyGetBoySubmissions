"description_html": "Inspired by family history, Grow House Grow's Cuba Collection is a vibrant homage to the island country and its resilient people. The line is comprised of three patterns: <br/><br/>1) Petticoat Palm: A dynamic palm print made in memory of the tenacious Cuban women who have influenced the designer's life. <br/><br/>2) Fauna Fantas\u00eda: A jungle print, designed for a story told by the designer's grandfather, illustrating the unusual fact that there are no deadly poisonous animals on Cuba's shores.<br/><br/>3) Santos Suarez: Named after the neighborhood the designer's mother grew up in, this trellis is evocative of Havana's interiors, as well as a symbol of the separation between Cubans who fled and those who remained behind. <br/><br/>Grow House Grow's wallpapers are hand silk-screened with care in NY state. Known for their narrative inspiration, each wallpaper has its own tale to tell. For further information, the full stories behind each pattern in the Cuba Collection can be found on www.growhousegrow.com.",
