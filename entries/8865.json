"description_html": "The Sutter is milled out of solid brass right down the street from our studio in Los Angeles. Each piece is then carefully brushed by hand to give it a very soft, satin texture. The Sutter will develop a rich, natural patina as the piece matures with age and use. <br/><br/>The Sutter also comes in a black finish, which is milled out of solid aluminum and then anodized with a flat black finish. This is a timeless design that will look amazing in any space, from your kitchen cabinets to a built in dresser. <br/><br/>You can choose from 2 different widths, 1\" or .5\"<br/>Dimensions: Width / 1\"W OR .5\"W x 2\"H x 1.25\" projection",
