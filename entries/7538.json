"description_html": "The CH23 dining chair was one of the first four chairs Hans J. Wegner designed specifically for Carl Hansen &amp; S\u00f8n in 1950, heralding a long and fruitful collaboration between the two. An early example of Hans J. Wegner's unique style and insightful craftsmanship, the CH23 renders sophisticated, complex designs simple and elegant.<br/><br/>Despite the CH23's richness in unique detail, its appearance is ultimately light and simple. Wegner's superbly refined woodwork is evident in the cruciform cover caps, which he used to mark the junction between the form-pressed veneer backrest and the chair's frame. The chair has no armrests, which makes it practical for fitting around the table, even in small rooms. Thanks to its ingenious design and organic form, it is also unsurpassed for comfort: the shape of the elegant cover caps in the backrest, the special double-woven paper cord seat, and the arched shape of the rear legs ensure optimal stability.<br/><br/>The CH23 is made of solid oak or walnut, or a combination of these in a variety of finishes. The elegant cover caps on the backrest are available in either oak or walnut, and the special double-woven seat in either natural or black paper cord.",
