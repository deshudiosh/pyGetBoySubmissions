Embodying the simple beauty of sculptural form, the intriguing, three-dimensional tiles are an artful expressions in scale, proportion and visual presentation.<br/><br/>Bar-On has always been intrigued by textures, shapes and colors, which has been employed to create his many varied products and separates Bar-On designs from the mainstream marketplace. His collection for ANN SACKS reflects his deep understanding of proportional space on the largest of scales, and his artistic talent of taking common materials and presenting them in an extraordinary new way. <br/><br/>The very nature of the concrete medium adds to the textural abandon of these tiles \u2013 smooth to the touch and softly honed, its surface randomly broken with pits and other marks occurring during the pouring and curing process.
