"description_html": "Gres stool was created from a piece that was first designed by Miguel Mil\u00e1 back in 1962. Though it was not included in the initial plans which basically consisted of a new rattan chair, after landing purely by chance in Expormim during one of Mil\u00e1\u2019s trips to the factory, it ended up shaping two new products: a high and a low stool. <br/>Its structure made of peeled natural rattan emerges from a game of tangent lines between its four organic frames and of those with the seat, thus securing stability and at the same turning it almost transparent. It is finished with a three step coating (dye, base coat and top coat) highly resistant to solar radiation thanks to UV filters. Multliple options are available for the seat upholstery: natural and faux leather, pure virgin wool fabric, velvet and polypropylene. <br/>This updated version of the historic stool turns it into an essential piece and emphasizes the everlasting validity of a particular design method, one standing aside from fashion trends and the conventions of a specific era. Mil\u00e1 in his true essence. No expiration date.",
