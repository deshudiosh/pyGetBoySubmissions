"description_html": "Alape, the leading German manufacturer of glazed steel sinks, fully exploits its possibilities to design its new basin, WP.FO. WP.FO is not a simple basin \u2013 it is a delicate workpiece that embraces the corresponding furniture to create a homogeneous unity. With WP.FO, furniture and washstand become an intrinsic work of art inspired by current trends of modern architecture.<br/><br/>The visual appearance of WP.FO perfectly lives up to modern bathroom expectations. Based on a concept by Gerhard Busalt, the shape of the homogeneous body \u2014 which combines basin, shelf and furniture \u2014 reveals influences of modern architecture. WP.FO combines material lightness and functionality into an extraordinary balance. The optimized storage space with hidden drawer runners creates the required bathroom space. The handle-less furniture is equipped with a push-to-open mechanism. Drawers can be equipped with internal drawer dividers, dispenser boxes and shelves to achieve the desired functionality.",
