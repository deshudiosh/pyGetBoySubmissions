"description_html": "Tinted Paper Terrazzo and Tonal Paper Terrazzo are the result of Formica Corporation\u2019s approach to recycled materials. With future generations in mind, natural and manmade materials collaborate to create something entirely new. Recycling goes further as we rethink what we throw away, resulting in something totally original. The intent is not only to enhance our resources, but also to manipulate and marry them with synthetic materials to create intriguing new composites. For example, two Paper Terrazzo patterns utilize small fragments of post-production solid-color paper from Formica\u00ae Laminate that would otherwise have gone to waste.",
