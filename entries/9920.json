"description_html": "Cassero elevates the current aesthetic of concrete with the rustic yet refined linear texture of wooden concrete forms. Transcending industrial design, Cassero\u2019s distinct approach to concrete transforms upscale commercial environments with a modern perspective that is both sophisticated and inviting.<br/><br/>Four neutral, sandy tones lend a naturally contemporary edge to the floor plane. Use one colorway to achieve a fluid surface with innate movement, or combine multiple tones to delineate spaces and increase visual intrigue. <br/><br/>Suitable for both interior and exterior environments, Cassero also allows designers to extend the floor and cohesively connect the indoors and outdoors for a multifaceted space. The porcelain tile series is available in two large format plank sizes, 24\u201d x 47\u201d and 12\u201d x 24\u201d, and a matte finish.",
