"description_html": "Call us crazy, but we're introducing a table where the legs and tabletop are not the main features. The highlights are the universal central connecting pieces (those cool looking metal brackets) that can be customized to add a splash of color. Mix and match the top, legs and metal connecting pieces to fit your needs.<br/>This is a table where the legs and the tabletop are NOT the key-elements. The key element is the universal central connecting piece which fits and connects all sizes. The Y-shaped connector is designed with 120\u00b0angles, is the main structural element and is the basis for a variety of combinations.<br/><br/>\"Inspiration for the Mint Collection emerged from a list of questions: <br/>Can I create a collection of tables that share the same elements? Using like parts? Integrating power supply and USB hubs seamlessly? After many studies and 1:1 models, it became clear that neither the legs nor the tabletop are the key elements \u2013 but a universal central connecting piece which fits and connects all sizes was the solution.\" - Rainer Mutsch<br/><br/>Primary materials:<br/>Legs: solid maple, solid walnut, Top: Russian birch ply with HPL surface, powder coated steel brackets",
