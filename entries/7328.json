"description_html": "One part abstract art, one part functional light, Shroom is a loose artistic impression resembling a mushroom. The LED pendant\u2019s gills are comprised of 30 vertical aluminum blades held together by intricate and clever milled aluminum top and bottom caps. Illuminated from within its acrylic core and a down light, Shroom features 12 volt energy efficient LEDs, creating a mesmerizing display as light reflects from the aluminum blades.<br/><br/>Shroom is a nothing if not an innovative lighting design. Created for an Alice in Wonderland-themed bar display at IDS Vancouver 2016, lead designer Maurice L. Dery \u201ctravelled down the rabbit hole\u201d when creating this pendant. <br/><br/>Providing both mood and task lighting, Shroom can be suspended on its own or hung with a multiple pendant arrangement. Each viewing angle produces a new result. <br/><br/>Project specs: The light is 584.2 mm diameter x 405.3 mm high. Designed Fall 2016.<br/><br/>Finishes available: Brasslike light gold, silver or black.",
