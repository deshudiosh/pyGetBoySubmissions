"description_html": "The Lily Chair takes its cue from the sinuous form of the Lilypad. It features a continuous unbroken line that traces the exterior of the chair which encases a soft circular cushion much like the center of a blooming flower. The chair subtly converges from an open bloom at the top, to a perfect circle at the base.\u201d<br/><br/>The Lily chair is available on a stationary base or a base with a self-returning swivel mechanism. Lily is a fully upholstered lounge chair that may be specified in Bernhardt Textiles leather and fabrics or the customer\u2019s own material. Topstitching is employed around the perimeter to highlight the continuous loop of the chair\u2019s design.<br/><br/>In keeping with the exceptional resources of Bernhardt Design, each design in the Terry Crews collection meet all BIFMA standards for use in contract spaces.<br/><br/>Lily is GREENGUARD certified. Bernhardt Design and Bernhardt Textiles is an EPA Climate Leading Partner, and facilities are certified and level audited. Made in the USA.",
