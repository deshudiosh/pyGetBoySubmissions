"description_html": "Workshop/APD by Desiron marks New York-based architecture and design firm Workshop/APD\u2019s first commercially available furniture collection and is largely inspired by American Craftsmanship and the power of man and machine. It highlights the strength and raw beauty of natural materials as exposed to the elements overtime with blackened steel, hand-charred woods and textured basalt stones and combines those natural pieces with modern black delrin and glass. <br/><br/>In bringing the collection to life, Desiron leveraged the skills and abilities of the artisans at its 30,000 square foot New Jersey factory experimenting with the ancient Japanese art of Shou Sugi Ban to create blackened wood while also developing a raw, gradient metal finish called \u201coil quenched steel\u201d that creates an amber in both color and texture. <br/><br/>\u201cIn designing this collection, we were particularly inspired by the use of materials and how they tell the story of the artisans who manipulate them,\u201d said Matt Berman, Co-Founder and Principal of Workshop/APD. \u201cWe were drawn to the idea of the craftsperson and chose to use textured stones, metals that show a natural patina and wood that was charred by hand using Desiron\u2019s expert techniques.\u201d <br/><br/>The five-piece collection consists of a Bench, Console, Wall Hooks, Bar Cart and Floor Mirror. The pieces are representative of Workshop/APD\u2019s crafted modern approach to architecture and interiors with a streamlined, dark elegance that has been brought to life by the master wood workers, metal fabricators and professional finishers at Desiron, led by President and Creative Director, Frank Carfaro.",
