"description_html": "For years, the neutral tones of blue, grey, and ivory have dominated in the rug industry. Loloi changes all that with its Javari Rug Collection, a product of ruthless editing and ongoing refinement. In fact, Loloi spent nearly a year exploring different colors and constructions. The result: twelve stunning designs with up to 25 colors in each design. The Javari Collection takes the floor to new heights with its distressed all-over patterns modernized through bold colors that enliven and transform any room. This collection is also engineered for long-lasting durability, with power-loomed polyester and polypropylene construction that ensures very limited shedding.<br/><br/>Javari is seen by many designers as a refreshing edit of rugs that finally brings some much-needed vibrancy to a product category that so often lacks options with brighter hues. The beauty of this collection is its ability to pull almost any color from the rug and highlight it in your space. And for neutral decor lovers, Javari offers an opportunity to add a little subtle, easy-to-live-with color in their homes.",
