"description_html": "Following the success of the original BuzziMe chair, BuzziSpace teamed again with designer Axel Enthoven to create BuzziMe Low, the latest addition to the BuzziMe family.<br/><br/>With a new, lower back and simpler silhouette, BuzziMe Low features the same acoustic capabilities as its predecessor, with a more versatile design that allows it to fit in a wider range of environments. Upholstered in BuzziFabric, one of BuzziSpace\u2019s signature sound-absorbing materials made of recycled wool, BuzziMe Low adds acoustic softness to any space, while still encouraging conversation with its swivel base and welcoming, open appearance. BuzziMe Low\u2019s clean design and personality makes it a soft lounge seating option well-suited for virtually any setting, from offices and commercial contexts, to hospitality spaces and homes. <br/><br/>BuzziMe Low is available in one size (W 71.5 cm, D 93 cm, H 92 cm) and in a range of BuzziFabric colors, with the added option of customizing a dual-tone shell. Pair it with the BuzziMe Ottoman \u2013 also available in the same selection of colors \u2013 for an extra comfortable seating experience, perfect for those moments when you want to sink back, throw your feet up, and relax.",
