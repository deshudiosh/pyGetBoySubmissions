"description_html": "Trapezoid by CUTTOFFS is using 5 inch wide half hexagons made from 3 different colors of Reclaimed White Oak. Each piece is cut by hand and then assembled on a plank. The wood is surface sanded, but left unfinished to maintain the natural patina of the wood.<br/><br/>CUTTOFFS\u2019 wood walls are nothing like the pressed wood panels in your grandmother\u2019s rumpus room back in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s. The company puts a strong focus on innovative and unique designs and offers modern and rustic options from reclaimed wood planks to a variety of 3 dimensional patterns. Trapezoid is the newest addition to the eclectic wood wall collection by Cuttoffs.",
