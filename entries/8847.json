"description_html": "Majestic and magnificent,\u00a0Pandora's sophisticated arrangement of color and pattern is as powerful as its mythical namesake. This densely woven, cotton velvet has a remarkable construction, featuring alternating stripes of color that shift in a rhythm of cut and uncut loops. Contemporary with a retro flair, Pandora's six color combinations include a multicolored array of artistic potential with colorways such as Phoenix, Griffin and Minotaur. <br/><br/>A 50\" upholstery pattern with a large-scale (8-1/8\" vertical and 12-1/2\" horizontal) repeat and an abrasion resistance of over 75,000 double rubs (Wyzenbeek, Cotton Duck), Pandora offers residential luxury with contract level durability.",
