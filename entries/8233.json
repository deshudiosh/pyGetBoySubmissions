"description_html": "The Lotus Pendant\u2019s white, curved forms, arrayed in suspension, direct bright light up, down, and through the spaces between its lotus-like petals, producing soft luminous reflections and a radiant glow. \u201cDriven to discover new insight and to test boundaries, our creative process achieved a new wave of sculptural expression.
