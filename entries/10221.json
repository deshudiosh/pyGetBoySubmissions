"description_html": "Brut, Sonoma Forge\u2019s first kitchen faucet with pull-out spray merges functionality and versatility with eclectic style. An industrial chic design standing 16\u00bc inches tall, Brut exudes a ruggedness that summons to mind raw plumbing pipes and couplings. With a reach of 9\u00be inches, the elbow spout swivels with no problem over larger sinks and a hidden button on the pull-out activates the dual-spray function to hit every corner. A single-control lever handle simplifies things in a design that\u2019s as at home in a country farmhouse as it is in an urban loft. Brut comes in Rustic Copper, Satin Nickel, Oil Rubbed Bronze and Rustic Nickel finish. Sonoma Forge\u2019s Brut kitchen pullout faucet, and all of its designer faucets and fixtures, are Made in USA.",
