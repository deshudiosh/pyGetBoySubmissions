"description_html": "The #NETworking Ping Pong Conference Table is Formaspace Office's answer to the changing function of the conference room and evolution of workplace culture. Furniture doesn't always have to operate for a singular purpose, it can function around many purposes. With the #NETworking table (that's a silent hashtag), we're serving up a multifunctional piece that easily transforms from a sitting conference table into two independently height adjustable collaboration tables that can be reattached as a standing height conference table, and then into a regulation 5'x9' ping pong table. <br/>When split apart, users can adjust the height of each half from any Bluetooth enabled device or on the attachments. Have a smart phone or conference room control panel? Just download the app and adjust the electric lifts to the ideal height. This unique ping pong table also includes two paddle holders beneath the surface for storage of the four complimentary hardwood ping pong paddles.<br/>While promoting wellness, this product combines work and play. End users gather around the table for an intense table tennis playoff match between in-house rivals, break out into collaboration mode with co-workers, and deliver their latest pitch while sitting or standing. The A&amp;D community has asked for truly differentiated, authentic, and unique furnishings. As you may have heard from NeoCon, #NETworking is here.",
