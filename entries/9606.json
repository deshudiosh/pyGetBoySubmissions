"description_html": "The work expresses the eclectic nature of the artist.<br/>In \u201cRay-on\u201d Alessia Niero in fact sought to create and succeeded in creating a mix of classic and contemporary, starting from a fabric she made when she first started work with Rubelli: the damask \u201cMocenigo \u201c which won the prestigious Navette D\u2019Or award at the Biennale des Editeurs in Paris in 1994. <br/>The absolute key feature of the work created for the exhibition/installation is the light which gives shape and substance to the decorative motif. <br/>In this new hi-tech version the artist, instead of using the original natural yarns for the weaves, adopts optical fibre: a wire which, appropriately powered, lights up, defining the areas of the decorative pattern of the work itself.<br/>The result is a textile creation that covers and contains the artist\u2019s training and professional career, in a \u201cluminous\u201d fusion of past and present, with a glance towards the future.",
