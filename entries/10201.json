"description_html": "As technology dominates the workplace, we find ourselves thinking\u2014and re-thinking\u2014 about how we use spaces. Moving beyond more traditional desking arrangements and encouraging new ways of working where they make sense. Walk through any office environment and you\u2019ll find that relaxed, flexible workspaces with soft furniture have replaced dedicated conference rooms and desk chairs. But power still needs to go where you go, and people are looking for the comforts of home without sacrificing the immediacy of access to technology. That\u2019s where Tully comes in.<br/><br/>Tully tucks right into those comfortable spaces with you, to keep you powered no matter where or how you\u2019re working. Its seamless construction and rounded corners are perfect for getting cozy in chairs, couches\u2014without concerns about scratches or snags. The unique tail design underneath allows it to fit securely between cushion and arm for all the stability you need, without the commitment of a built-in solution.<br/><br/>Not to be underestimated, Tully\u2019s compact design profile also packs a lot of power with Byrne\u2019s patented spill-proof outlet, as well as USB-A and new USB-C charging options.<br/><br/>Relax while checking messages. Sit back while working on your laptop. Tully adds versatility to any office space, turning previously underutilized open areas into hardworking soft seating, ideal for collaborative or solo work. <br/><br/>Work environments might change, but the need to stay charged and connected never does. Tully can close that distance between the dynamic demands of the workplace and the casual ease of home\u2014all while keeping power comfortably by your side.",
