"description_html": "Ancient Doors was inspired by a visit to Fork York in Toronto, Canada where the wooden and metal lock gates grabbed the attention of our designer. The texture from the wood grain has been translated into the design. The soft grey and blue undertone palette, contrasts with the rough texture and dark colour of the wood and metal knobs from the Fort York gate. The blend of tones in this carpet allow for the dominant colour to vary from grey to blue, even purple depending on what colours it is paired with. Ancient Doors lays at 6 feet by 9 feet.<br/><br/>Ancient Doors has been handcrafted in Nepal by talented artisans through every step of the design and manufacturing process. This carpet has been made with 100% hand-carded and hand-spun Himalayan Sheep wool. Woven in our Vaara Collection weaving style, creating a high density of knots which allows for smooth gradation of colours and intense detail. The wool has been dyed with eco-friendly certified dyes and washed with the most sustainable practise. <br/><br/>Amala Carpets sits on six generations of wool traders and handmade carpet manufacturers. Committed to manufacturing the highest quality handmade carpets, while maintaining sustainable and ethical practises.",
