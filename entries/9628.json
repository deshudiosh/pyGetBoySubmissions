"description_html": "NORTH design by Arik Levy, is the evolution of solution based lighting design. Inspired by the balance of a trapeze artists, it is elegant, dynamic and adaptable. Composed of traditional shades suspended from a slim carbon fiber rod structure which attaches to the wall, NORTH extends outward from the wall at various heights and angles to take the place of a traditional floor lamp or pendant application. The sconce uses LED as a source of illumination, providing a uniform light that becomes concentrated with the smaller shade options for a more intense beam. North comes in four finishes: matte graphite lacquer, matte blue lacquer, matte cream lacquer and matte white lacquer.",
