Entirely made in rod steel, the collection is composed of two versions: chair and stool.<br/>The strong aesthetic identity does not affect the functionality that a chair has to have, in fact the front angles of the seat are cut to facilitate the end user to get up, also for stool version. The different colored finishing available make Ribelle an object of design suitable for any environment",
