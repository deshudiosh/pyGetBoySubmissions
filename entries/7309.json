"description_html": "With almost every rug that Kasthall manufactures, spools of yarn are left over. They used to go unused - not ideal for a company that prides itself on environmental stewardship. This quandary sparked a lightbulb moment for in-house designer Ellinor Eliasson, who gathered the castoffs for a collection she has christened Harvest. The wool yarn is sorted into size color families: pink-purple, blue, green, red-yellow, brown-beige and gray. Woven into patterns based on traditional Swedish rag rugs, the yarn colors shift as one spool ends and another begins. Available in standard and custom sizes.",
