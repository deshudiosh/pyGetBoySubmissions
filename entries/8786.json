Industrial references create high-tech light-and-shadow effects, giving surfaces a dynamic three-dimensional appeal. West Loop (named for the emerging Chicago neighborhood and resembling textured industrial concrete) is unique due to its high variance in color including 35 shading patterns, with metal undertones. Four colors (Anthracite, Sand, Grey and White) are available in the following sizes, 24x48, 24x24, 12x24, 8x48, 12x12 mosaic and 4x12 diamond.",
