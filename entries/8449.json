"description_html": "Axo Light presents the new wall lamps collection Lik, designed by Serge and Robert Cornelissen. <br/><br/>The combination between the technical-functional aspects and esthetical ones is Lik\u2019s main feature: the collection is an example of how the best design can be at the service of function. In fact the form, minimal and essential, makes it possible to install a small but intense lighting source that creates a light beam reflecting itself on the ceiling.<br/><br/>Lik is a small but powerful mark, capable to characterize every space, because it defines the place without changing it. The lamp can be used in an artistic and versatile way, installing single or multiple devices, in order to satifly the different lighting design needs. <br/><br/>Lik is available in white, bronze and matt nickel finishing and in the following sizes: L 3 7/8\u201d - W 3 7/8\u201d - H 7 1/4\u201d cm.",
