"description_html": "The Japanese tradition of weaving thin Paulownia wood onto a paper backing has been modernized for more versatile design options. Ajiro wood veneer wallcoverings can turn corners and wrap columns. Following the contemporary look of our Ajiro Chevron, the Grand Scale expands the design with 15-inch wide stripes that transform large spaces into spectacular settings. Cost effective and environmental, this renewable resource is beautifully stained in 15 hues and hand-finished in our Chicago studio. Ajiro wood veneer wallcoverings are an attractive alternative to costly millwork.",
