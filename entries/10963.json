"description_html": "KLAD\u2122 Stitched Leather Walls is a new innovative, and often requested component to Keleen's KLAD\u2122 offering. The stitch detailing is an element designers have been asking of us in all of our leather tile programs for decades. This sophisticated element greatly enhances the appearance of these already stunning tiles. Many options exist for the stitch details such as color of thread, length of stitch and denier of this stitch element. These options not only offer design elements of hue and contrast, but also a texture created by the stitching. We feel the stitch option now takes Keleen Leathers KLAD\u2122 offering to an extremely higher level of demand and interior wall adornment. <br/><br/>Keleen's KLAD\u2122 luxury leather wall system is known for being the most economical leather wall system on the market. Also a huge feature of KLAD\u2122 is the ease of installation; merely roll the adhesive on the wall and apply the tiles. Truly this is a DYI \"Do It Yourself\" ease of installation, and if you damage a tile, simply peel it off and replace with a new one.",
