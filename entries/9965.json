"description_html": "The motorcycle is a potent symbol of American mythology, signaling strength and freedom of expression. It\u2019s possible, in Desmond\u2019s angle-cut arms and knurled bulb base, to see a homage to this iconic vehicle. Even in the straight, single pendant, Desmond shows its strength. Fitted with spiral carbon-filament bulbs, no detail is too small to be designed. Desmond is available in a variety of sizes which makes it suitable for any room in the home. The perfectly detailed yet quintessentially minimalist Desmond seeks to reinterpret an iconic American symbol of freedom through industrial features and it simultaneously focuses on minute details while having an overall streamlined design with its knurled cut base.",
