"description_html": "Pendleton by Sunbrella was born from the idea of bringing two heritage brands together, combining Pendleton Woolen Mills\u2019 distinct aesthetic and the enduring performance qualities of Sunbrella fabrics \u2013 easy care, fade proof, and bleach cleanable. The collection tells the story of those who walked the land before us, a sunset painting a colorful palette, and the mountain range creating texture underhand.<br/><br/>To support the collection \u2013 whose story unfolds across the plains of American history \u2013 Glen Raven Custom Fabrics created a photo booklet to be used as a sales tool.<br/><br/>The oversized booklet highlights the concept of what the Pendleton by Sunbrella collection is at its root \u2013 heritage and authentic design. Large-scale, high-end photography is featured throughout the piece along with profiled hero patterns and swatches of supporting patterns. Copy is intentionally shaped to reflect the inspirations behind the collection, reminiscent of waves, mountain ranges and wildlife. White space played an important role in the design of this imaginative piece.<br/><br/>The materials selected for the booklet also tie into the Pendleton theme. The large format creates impact while the exposed binding technique complements the raw nature of the collection. A recycled white French paper was selected to convey a sense of vintage heritage.",
