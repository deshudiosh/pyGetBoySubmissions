"description_html": "Met\u00e1fora Collection tips its floppy hat to that gone by era of glitz, glam rock, and hippie chic. Offering a modern<br/>interpretation of the best of the 70\u2019s; touches of macram\u00e9, pointed collars and flared trousers can be seen throughout the patterns, bringing a retro modern twist to the collection while showcasing a fresh up to date feel with the beautifully synchronized colors. A contemporary twist on iconic trends of the past, the Met\u00e1fora Collection creates a statement that is both eye-catching and classic. Inspired by modern retro design, The Met\u00e1fora Collection creates a contemporary feel with a touch of nostalgia by layering striking shapes, textures and clean lines. A stunning mix of geometric, abstract and textural patterns, reminiscent of popular retro style, pair beautifully together or alone in an interior space. The sophisticated color palette includes an array of warm and cool grays, luxurious taupes and calming blues, plus bright hues such as paprika, lime and azure.
