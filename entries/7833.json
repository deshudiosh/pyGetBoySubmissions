"description_html": "Sophistication and simplicity characterize the design of the Powell &amp; Bonnell Jupiter reinforced plaster pendant fixture. The grand scale of the asymmetrical, octagonal bowl commands immediate attention, while the sublime detail of its subtly fluted, canted sides, rising to a shallow concave central point, encourages contemplation. Primed for custom painting or the application of specialty finishes. The canopy and suspension rods are available in Powell &amp; Bonnell metal finishes.",
