"description_html": "McGuire Furniture's Fall 2016 collection featured the brand\u2019s first lighting collection in more than a decade: 22 pieces by design master Jonathan Browning. Aptly inspired by the design traditions of Northern California in the 1970s, the light fixtures are timeless and subtly elegant. This dramatic Muir Chandelier, exclusively designed by Jonathan Browning for McGuire, combines Jonathan's decades of design with the shadows and shapes created on the valley floor of Muir Woods. Crafted from solid brass and distinct in form, a graphic cage - in a lite antique finish - becomes a study in repetition with ten layers at varying heights. Crystal diffusers in each of the cages mimic the sunlight that falls between the branches of the Northern California redwoods. Each solid brass cage is carefully crafted to achieve the angle, proportion and scale; the result in the chandelier is a work of art. The oil rubbed bronze sockets and 21.875\" diameter ceiling plate complete this piece.",
