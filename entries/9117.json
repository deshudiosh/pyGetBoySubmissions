"description_html": "Carefully constructed and thoughtfully interpreted, Piet and Theo represent complimentary scales of the grid concept. Together they form the Edge collection drawing inspiration from the use of a straight-edge when designing patterns with linear qualities.<br/><br/>Inspired from the proponents of the De Stijl movement,\u00a0Piet\u00a0uses a mod reduction of form and color in a rectilinear textile design. Named after Piet Mondrian, this 54\" upholstery fabric's minimalist motif is created to coordinate with its small-scale cousin, Theo. Piet offers six soft, neutral colorways with a large scale square design. Woven with marled weft Olefin yarns on a thick, wool-like polyester warp, Piet's characteristics imitate the qualities of wool while maintaining contract level performance. Designed for durability, Piet boasts an abrasion resistance of 100,000 double rubs (Wyzenbeek, Cotton Duck) and features Incase finish and acrylic backing.<br/><br/>Like its cousin Piet,\u00a0Theo\u00a0also exemplifies rectilinear design as promoted by the De Stijl movement. Named after Theo van Doesburg, this 54\u201d upholstery pattern is created to coordinate with Piet's large scale square design. Theo's small scale repeat is offered in an array of neutrals as well as pure primary colorways Red, Yellow, and Blue. Made from polyester and Olefin yarns and constructed with marled weft yarns on a thick, wool-like warp, Theo's characteristics imitate the qualities of wool while offering contract level performance. With Incase finish, acrylic backing and an abrasion resistance of 100,000 double rubs (Wyzenbeek, Cotton Duck), Theo is designed for durability.",
