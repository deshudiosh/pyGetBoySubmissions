"description_html": "The gradual, constant engineering of the production processes of architectural ceramics has made it possible to manufacture larger and larger sizes and develop more and more precise colour gradation systems, which also produce slabs of material in amazingly bright, shiny colours; at the same time, increasingly accurate controlled mechanisation of manufacturing cycles has helped to make the potential, minimal flaws in the finished product completely imperceptible. On the one hand, this has had the beneficial outcome of quality standards absolutely inconceivable until the recent past, but on the other it has often led to worries about the risk \u2013 intrinsic in a virtually \u201cperfect\u201d modular, mass-produced product \u2013 of minimising, or even completely eliminating, the stimulating visual variety once created by the sequential repetition of ceramic tiles when every one had its own, individual flaws.<br/>With the Cromatica collection, Formafantasma investigates fresh possibilities provided by the \u201ccolour factor\u201d in contemporary ceramics manufacturing, while at the same time meeting the need to provide continuous spreads of covering, technically perfect but still offering the fascinating potential for compositions of individual pieces which are never monotonous. The entire collection \u2013 produced in a variety of sizes \u2013 includes six basic colours, with two types of surface finish (one natural, the other glossy); the slab production cycle combines different technologies to deliver a rich lexicon of shades and gradations on the large surface of a single ceramic panel: the small sizes in the collection, \"offcuts\" from the larger slabs, are combined \u2013 even at random \u2013 to create compositions with a wide variety of colours, for design schemes featuring unique, original chromatic blends.<br/>The colour range developed for Cromatica is the outcome of in-depth design work conducted by Formafantasma with the aid of materials from the CEDIT archives; amongst the initial inspirations which stimulated the two designers\u2019 creativity in their search for a concept which could combine the brand\u2019s past with its near future, pride of place must definitely go to the major \u201ccolour definition\u201d work reflected by the \u201c41 Colors\u201d collection of glazed tiles, designed for the company by Ettore Sottsass at the end of the last century.",
