"description_html": "The Focal Point design team delivered on its mission to create a modern luminaire that embodies the flexibility in designing with an LED light source with the creation of Obscura. More than a linear suspended LED luminaire, Obscura exudes an air of mystery with a seemingly invisible light source to become a functional architectural statement. Obscura is creatively engineered to balance beauty and functionality with a wide batwing distribution (80% indirect and 20% direct lighting). This allows for increased spacing between luminaires; up to 16' on center.<br/><br/>Its soft yet powerful illumination, up to 129 LPW, meets the stringent energy efficiency standards of the DesignLights Consortium\u00ae (DLC). In addition to the optics and illumination qualities, Obscura offers personalization with individual lengths from 4' to 12' in 1' increments and modern finishes: White or Palladium Silver exterior body and White or Infinity interior end caps. Furthering its minimalist design, Obscura integrates Focal Point\u2019s Power-Up\u2122 technology where power is delivered through the aircraft suspension cables, eliminating the visual clutter of power cords. <br/><br/>Features: <br/>\u2022\tHidden optics provide an air of mystery with a seemingly invisible light source<br/>\u2022\t4\u2019 \u2013 12\u2019 individual units in 1\u2019 increments<br/>\u2022\tPowerful optic with up to 1200 Lm/ft<br/>\u2022\t80 direct/20 indirect distribution <br/>\u2022\tLow-voltage power is delivered through suspended cables<br/>\u2022\tExterior finishes: White and Palladium Silver<br/>\u2022\tInterior finishes: White and Infinity",
