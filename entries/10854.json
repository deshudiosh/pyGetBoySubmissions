"description_html": "The idea behind this product was to create a completely new style of heating system designed with hotel and restaurant guests in mind. The wall-mounted radiator comprises two 30mm diameter stainless steel pipes that come together to form a \u201cY\u201d. Housekeeping can stack fresh, folded or rolled towels into the upper area of the \u201cY\u201d so they are heated upon guests\u2019 arrival. The slant of the pipes and their snug fit against the wall ensures remaining towels stay securely in place as guests take one from the pile. Four discreet hooks on the parallel stems of the lower section provide additional storage options to warm hanging towels and are angled to echo the shape of the top part of the \u201cY\u201d, adding a sense of symmetry and continuity.<br/><br/>The innovative profile excels on both functional and aesthetic levels. Its modern and elegant contouring is very different from the classic ladder radiator, making it stand out as an object of interest as well as an efficient product. Energy-saving technology reduces operational costs with 120 watts used to generate a maximum surface temperature of 110\u00b0F.<br/><br/>Whilst radiators are often seen as a necessity, this fixture\u2019s unique shape encourages venues to instead consider it as a design object. A wide spectrum of finishes such as polished stainless steel, orange peel, bronze, European bronze, copper, black pearl, gold PVD, gold and white RAL9003 means the heater can complement any color palette and become a highlight within the interiors instead of merely a functional requirement.",
