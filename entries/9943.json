"description_html": "THE CLODAGH COLLECTION FOR RH, RESTORATION HARDWARE<br/>The Clodagh Sofa, Clodagh Lounge Chair, Clodagh Armchair, Clodagh Ottoman, Clodagh Chaise and Clodagh Sectionals comprise the Clodagh Collection for RH Outdoor. <br/><br/>We translated a contemporary metal chair originally designed for the indoors into an outdoor collection, featuring a variety of silhouettes rendered in resin. Reflecting the centuries-old art of basketry, the complex weave features straps of varying widths that crisscross to form a bold, open lattice. The warm bronze finish lends it the look of burnished metal, while the weave's negative space imparts airiness to the low, linear profile. <br/>\u201cI love the warm bronze finish of my collection for RH. There\u2019s quite a universality about it, and bronze is a kind color. I\u2019ve always believed that if something\u2019s too perfect, it\u2019s rather dull, which is why I incorporate Wabi Sabi as part of my design practice. Weaving takes care of that problem, because it\u2019s never perfect.\u201d- Clodagh<br/><br/>MANUFACTURER DESIGN DETAILS:<br/>\u2022\tArtisans weave all-weather resin straps by hand in 6 different widths over a rustproof, powder-coated aluminum inner frame<br/>\u2022\tAll-weather resin is durable and resists fading, cracking and tearing<br/>\u2022\tResin straps are finished with a finely ribbed texture that imparts a metallic-like sheen<br/>\u2022\tLofty, zippered and poly-filled seat and back cushions come in a choice of luxury performance Perennials\u00ae or Sunbrella\u00ae fabrics that resist mildew, stains and fading even after years of exposure to the elements",
