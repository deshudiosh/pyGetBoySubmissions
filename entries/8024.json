"description_html": "The design inspiration for the Cuff Table is based upon a cuff bracelet that would adorn one\u2019s arm. The simplicity of the overall form is composed of a slight tapering cone that transitions to a metal laser cut sleeve. This metal sleeve is the cuff or the \u2018jewelry\u2019 of the piece. The transparency of the metal cut outs play against the mass of the table creating a strong tension between the two. Four fashion-forward metal laser cut pattern options are<br/>available: Wave, Polka, Morse Code and Basket Weave.",
