"description_html": "Boccaporto, designed by Metrica, is a combined seating and working unit developed for open offices and public areas. The cubby unit takes on a softened square shape and cushioned hood to provide an isolated workspace for one to two people; the unit is thus versatile, working as a collaboration unit, as well as a location for individual work. Inset power and lighting capabilities elevate the unit, along with vibrant upholstery options, which makes Boccaporto a design focal point for a range of busy spaces, including libraries and airports. <br/><br/>This unique seating collection is modern in its aesthetic and technological deliverables, providing a station that is not only comfortable for the user, but pleasing to the eye as well.",
