"description_html": "Influenced by nature, structure, and the infinite possibilities of space, Kyle Bunting introduces his first artist collaboration with the Element Series by Abidemi. Born in Nigeria and raised in Lagos, Abidemi investigates the sublime and spiritual by exploiting shapes and voids. In collaboration with Kyle Bunting, Element is uniquely and beautifully transformed using hide, a material of incredible depth, dimension, and tactile expression.<br/><br/>Debuting in three subjective patterns, the Element Series showcases sporadically placed, angular shapes interlocked with one another through thin strips of hide. There is a congruity to the designs without them being predictable, where the use of color and light defines the shapes and voids within the patterns, encompassing Abidemi\u2019s central artistic theme of controlled chaos.<br/><br/>Unlike anything Kyle Bunting has developed before, the collaboration with Abidemi pushes the boundaries of fine art into a new and unique creative realm.",
