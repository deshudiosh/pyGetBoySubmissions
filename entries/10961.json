"description_html": "The contemporary back-to-wall design of the Eldon tub from Victoria + Albert is endowed with the curvaceous lines of a freestanding bath. The pipework is hidden beneath a full width plumbing deck, while a moulded tile upstand allows tiles to be easily installed around the rim to create a watertight seal. At 68-7/8\u201d long, Eldon is the perfect bath for large or small bathrooms where clean lines and day to day practicality are equally important.",
