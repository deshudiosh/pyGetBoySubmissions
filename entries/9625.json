"description_html": "NORTH, design by Arik Levy, is inspired by the balance of elegant, dynamic and adaptable. Composed of traditional shades suspended from either one or two slim carbon fiber rods, the structures are arranged to precariously overlap. NORTH pendants use LED as a source of illumination, providing a uniform light that becomes concentrated with the smaller shade options for a more intense beam that can be moved to balance and focus where its needed most. North comes in four finishes: matte graphite lacquer, matte blue lacquer, matte cream lacquer and matte white lacquer.",
