"description_html": "Blocks, designed in 2017, started as a collage in Sandy Chilewich\u2019s studio. Sandy was cutting up sections of discarded printed materials that she saved from old product development fabric. She adhered these different saturated colored sections onto one of her black woven textile surfaces. <br/>Collaborating with a local print shop in the Atlanta area brought Sandy\u2019s vision to life. In order to achieve the vibrant saturated colors onto a black surface, Blocks required printing multiple layers of ink colors with great precision. The outlines of each shape appear hand drawn but the placement of each color module is very deliberate and creates a bold yet whimsical backdrop for any place setting.<br/>Chilewich is recognized internationally for weaving textiles which are both beautiful as well as hardworking for a wide range of applications and are all made entirely in the US. Chilewich placemats and runners, made from these textiles have changed the way people dress their tables in their homes and in restaurants around the world. <br/>\u201cBlocks\u201d is the first in a series named \u201cChilewichEditions.\u201d These are smaller production runs of designs whose aesthetic expresses and satisfies a very personal viewpoint, namely that any table surface can act as a canvas and can provide an artful experience for a simple meal for one person or a celebration for many.",
