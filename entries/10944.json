"description_html": "The Kohler Tournant kitchen faucet combines style and traditional design with all the specialized features the experts rely upon. Tournant is a traditionally inspired faucet with modern industrial elements, and offers a powerful and laborsaving functionality that is up to any task.<br/>A three-function pull-down sprayhead gives users multiple options for getting the job done efficiently and thoroughly. The BerrySoft spray provides a softer spray that is gentle on fruits and vegetables, the Sweep spray offers a wide, powerful blade of water that cleans surfaces efficiently, and the aerated stream is perfect for filling pots.<br/><br/>This new faucet offers the same proprietary technology as other KOHLER kitchen faucets: a MasterClean sprayface with an easy-to-clean surface that resists mineral buildup, ceramic disk valves that ensure the faucet\u2019s durability, and DockNetik, an exclusive magnetic docking system that securely locks the sprayhead in place.<br/><br/>Tournant also has a removable coil that allows for easy cleaning, flexible supply lines that provide maximum mobility to the faucet, and a simple single control/single lever handle. It has a 1.5 gpm flow rate and is available in three finish options: Polished Chrome, Vibrant Polished Nickel, and Vibrant Stainless. For professional chefs who want to cook at home and homeowners who want to cook like the pros, the Tournant is a valuable tool that will save its user time and energy.",
