"description_html": "The Retreat Wing Back from Allsteel designed in collaboration with Niels Bendtsen works to solve the issue of under utilized social and collaborative settings in the workplace. \u201cThe wing-back design creates a sense of enclosure while still allowingusers to be aware of their surroundings and protect their back view. The lounges can be placed in a circle to define a room within a room or used individually against aisles to create a sense of<br/>privacy.\u201d said, Jason Heredia, Vice President, Product, Design &amp; Marketing at Allsteel. The Retreat lounge has a refined, residential look, thanks to Bendtsen\u2019s long experience creating timeless pieces in the category. But drawing on its office-practice and ergonomics expertise, Allsteel has made the chair\u2019s geometry, size and scale ideal for comfortable work. Compared to its living room counterpart, Retreat has an upright recline, a slightly higher and shallower seat, and lower arms to accommodate a variety of postures or laptop placements. The elegantly tapered base gives unobstructed access to the seat, making for easy entry and exit. The high back<br/>protects the rear of the head while the wings are positioned perfectly to allow for visual awareness of surroundings and yet at the same time to give the occupant a sense of privacy.<br/>\u201cThe organic-inspired silhouette of Retreat\u2019s Wing Back chair is refined but approachable,\u201d said designer Niels Bendtsen. \u201cThe collection offers designers and architects the opportunity to create quietly distinctive environments that combine inviting aesthetics with work-friendly functionality\".",
