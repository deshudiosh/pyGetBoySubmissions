"description_html": "WAY MATERIA Kitchen by Snaidero Design<br/><br/>A RIGOROUS ARCHITECTURAL STYLE AND ULTRA-CLEAN AESTHETICS<br/><br/>WAY MATERIA (an evolution of WAY a GOOD DESIGN\u2122 Award winner) is a cabinetry line developed by Snaidero\u2019s own Design Department. Using the company\u2019s 70-year experience in kitchen design, this specialized team focuses on creating cabinet systems that meet market needs. A revolutionary concept that employs ceramic slabs of pure porcelain stoneware. <br/><br/>CONCEPT<br/>Clear-Cut Architectural Design<br/>WAY MATERIA features simple design lines expressed through a very rich range of elements, allowing for limitless layout solutions. <br/><br/>\u2022 The Laminam ceramic fronts feature long porcelain stoneware surfaces in just 3 mm thickness. A technologically innovative solution that provides superior resistance and sophisticated aesthetics. The Laminam ceramic serves as a hygienic and antibacterial surface that withstands sharp blades, hot liquids and oils. <br/>\u2022To maintain a streamlined aesthetic WAY MATERIA replaces the traditional handle with a continuous channel in anodized aluminum alloy with Titanium finish. The channel can be applied to both horizontal and vertical door openings. <br/>\u2022The door-opening channel is also featured on the side end panels (either 1.2 cm or 7.5 cm thick) to maintain aesthetic continuity.<br/>\u2022WAY MATERIA offers extreme flexibility of storage space, with cabinets, wall units, and tall units available in different heights and widths to develop the design vertically or horizontally \u2013 whichever is the preferred solution<br/>\u2022Four types of open elements \u2013 available in seven different colors \u2013 make it possible to create dynamic compositions on wall units, tall units, under-wall units, and even in the living areas.<br/>\u2022Continuity with the living area is also guaranteed thanks to the boiserie element, available in all door finishes, with 3 cm-thick shelves of variable depths and integrated LED lights.<br/>\u2022The recessed toekick creates a \u201cfloating\u201d effect and is available in two heights (10 cm and 23 cm) to bring the cabinets to the level that is most comfortable for the user.<br/>\u2022Countertops are available in 4 different thicknesses, with materials including granite, quartz stone, solid surface, quartzite, steel and glass.<br/>\u2022WAY MATERIA comes in a range of over 100 different colors (even tailor made color options) and finishes, from melamine and wood veneer to glossy and frosted glass as well as a variety of lacquers, including Snaidero\u2019s exclusive micalized lacquer.<br/>MADE-IN-ITALY CRAFTSMANSHIP<br/>Snaidero\u2019s highly skilled craftsmen work as a throwback carpentry workshop inside the company\u2019s high-tech Italian factory to refine each piece and add unique details. <br/>Like all Snaidero kitchens, WAY MATERIA is manufactured and designed with respect for the environment and human health. Green features include: <br/>\u2022100% post-consumer wood, certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) as being 100% Recycled<br/>\u2022Cabinet structure panels using glues and resins with extremely low formaldehyde emission levels - less than a half of the standard set by the LFE E1 international certification, which is even stricter than the standard of the California Air Resources Board<br/>\u2022Water-based matte lacquer varnishes and cabinet coatings that reduce VOC emissions by 95%",
