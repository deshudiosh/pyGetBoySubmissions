"description_html": "Visual connection between an instructor and students is difficult in a large active learning environment when there are fixed monitors and columns. Optimal learning and engagement needs both physical and virtual barriers to be removed, allowing students and instructors to freely engage with both analog and digital tools. The Verb\u00ae Active Media Table was designed to allow for unobstructed technology support for the classroom, creating an optimized learning environment.<br/><br/>The active media table complements the existing Verb product line with versatile, intuitive and unobstructed technology support for the classroom. Its monitor lift eliminates the need to mount technology to a wall or column, improving sightlines during lectures and enhancing collaboration during group work. The mobile table can support a range of existing technology and provide a flexible, cost-effective solution for institutions. <br/><br/>As part of the Verb\u2122 classroom collection, the Active Media Table supports technology- and analog-driven instruction. The collection blends seamlessly with Steelcase Education portfolio of products including the Node\u00ae chair. Schools can choose from rectangle, square, round and taper table options.",
