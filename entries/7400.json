"description_html": "Riedel, the 300-year old family credited with revolutionizing glassware for the enjoyment of wine, announces the newest trio in its growing collection of mouth-blown decanters: the M Series. Inspired by vintage cognac bottles, the Marne, Margaux, and Macon\u2014each named for a venerated wine region\u2014offer a classic shape that suits any tablescape. <br/><br/>The Marne, with its bulbous shape, keeps the wine perpetually moving, slowly working any sediment into its sturdy base; while the Margaux features broad shoulders and a pronounced punt for easy handling. Finally, the Macon strikes a unique bell shape, steadily increasing the surface area of the wine as the decanter empties, leaving sediment behind. <br/><br/>Keeping to Riedel\u2019s philosophy of form follows function, each decanter in this series features a wide body, allowing for ample surface area, and a narrow pour-spout for easy serving. \u00acThe decanters, freely formed witout molds, have modern, yet classic designs, answering the current consumer taste for home design with heritage.",
