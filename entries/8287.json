"description_html": "Naja Utzon Popov's Oceania rug collection for Carl Hansen &amp; S\u00f8n reflects the encounter between Scandinavian and Japanese nature, an inexhaustible treasure trove of shapes, colors, structures, and textures.<br/><br/>The two rugs in the Oceania collection, Coral and Seabed, bear clear references to water: one to the cryptic, underwater life of the coral reef, the other to the cracks and fissures in salt marches, dried sand or the crust of the sun-scorched earth. The pattern universe captures dynamic movement, which Utzon Popov feels expresses more of an emotional state that an actual exploration of specific marine environments.<br/><br/>Utzon Popov's color palette is inspired by Carl Hansen &amp; S\u00f8n's classic furniture, creating and open dialogue with furniture design without dominating the overall impression. The rugs carry their own unique identity and interact freely with interior decor.<br/><br/>The rugs, available in three color combinations and three sizes, are hand-tufted from wool and sustainable Tencel derived from the fibers of beech tree. Tencel adds a soft, silky finish that elegantly contrasts with the wool's matte look, helping to highlight Utzon Popov's expressive patterns and colors.",
