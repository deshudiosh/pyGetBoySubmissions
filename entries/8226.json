"description_html": "Enveloping, suggestive, warm and at the same time technological, Nuez Chair offers a double<br/>texture: that of the shell \u2013<br/>formed by three\u2013dimensional<br/>undulations that give it<br/>movement \u2013 and that of<br/>the upholstery, which also<br/>involves complex and studied<br/>manufacturing, an authentic<br/>innovation. The wooden legged and cantilever versions, <br/>the range of ten distinct colors<br/>for the shell and numerous<br/>upholstery options for the seat<br/>and backrest, make Nuez a<br/>tremendously versatile seat with a distinctive aesthetic for guest environments.",
