"description_html": "The contemporary office needs spaces with an informal lounge atmosphere where employees are able to hold spontaneous meetings in small groups or for just relaxing. This requirement is met by Tapa \u2013 a system of modular poufs with organic geometric forms designed by Mac Stopa. <br/><br/>This unique product, available in a wide range of colors, combines a striking look with clever functionality. A modular solution whose basic element is an island consisting of poufs that turn on a pivot, Tapa combines the functionality of a sofa, chair, side table and stool into one unique modular system. <br/><br/>Resembling small architecture, or a sculpture, rather than a piece of furniture, Tapa ensures a variety of arrangements using several modules. The line also comes with additional cushions that can be placed on the third and fourth level of the basic modular unit.",
