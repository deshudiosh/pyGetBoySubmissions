"description_html": "Yoka, referring \u201cthe smell of ocean\u201d in Japanese, brings the dynamism of nature to the workplace with its modest design and ergonomic structure. Yoka pulls down the monotony of traditional workplaces thanks to its transversal legs and its elliptical form presents extraordinary illusions in any space. Yoka offers an innovative and functional design with its characteristic legs, a table top with special finishes and table-mounted storage systems with rounded edges. Felt separator panels, which are compatible with different uses and also available for storage purposes, support focusing. Yoka differentiates offices in detail beyond personalization and adds value with engineering solutions as well as design.",
