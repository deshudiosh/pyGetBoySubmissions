"description_html": "Motawi Tileworks is a maker of fine American Art Tile, handcrafted with a design aesthetic that is both historically-inspired and often borrowed from the natural world. The company believes that it enriches the world with its beautiful products and healthy business practice. Life at Motawi is lively, positive, cooperative, process-driven and result-oriented. The tiles are created for use in homes, commercial buildings, and public places, and are installed world-wide. It has been several years since Motawi has introduced new tile installation product. In 2015, new products began their prototyping stages and several were added into the Motawi stock. It was decided then, that all of the new tiles, glazes and photographs needed a large stage for their debut. Motawi Tileworks employs one (very talented in our opinion) graphic designer who painstakingly laid out this entire catalog in a way that is both efficient and beautiful. The catalogs are hand-distributed to prospective installation clients, architects and designers who are all clamoring for a Motawi tile installation.",
