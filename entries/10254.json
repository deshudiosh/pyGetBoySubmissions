"description_html": "Aesthetically, Ruby saw an opportunity to incorporate softer forms into the design not only to add comfort but also to make the lounge less formal, and more easygoing and approachable. She crafted strong square geometries on the lounge\u2019s exterior, juxtaposing this element with loose, soft cushions and rounded edges on the seat to deliver a warm, inviting place to sit and relax.<br/><br/>The 25 components in this line include one-, two- and three-seat lounges; benches; and coffee, laptop, and side tables. Options include a choice of four arms styles: two-arm, left-arm, right-arm or armless; frames available in standard powder-coats or an upgrade to polished chrome or brushed stainless; and table surfaces available in: laminate, veneer, glass, or solid-surface, with an option to accept field-installed stone tops.",
