"description_html": "Ambient Cocoon<br/>Mimicking the perfect texture and symmetry of silk cocoons, these minimal and delicate<br/>looking lanterns are deceptively tough. Manufactured from modern plastics and combined<br/>with a striking solid teak handle of almost agricultural purity, these (solar LED) lights are as<br/>much about design as they are about illumination.<br/><br/>Danish designer Henrik Pedersen has combined an extensive background in interior<br/>lighting with an intimate knowledge of outdoor furniture to create the Ambient collection.<br/>Asked about the design influences, Henrik says \u201cMy path in design has led me through<br/>many parts of the world, many cultures\u2026 Light and warmth are always principal parts<br/>of the best social environments and the most modest of devices are often the most<br/>effective. Here I combine the worlds of simplicity and light to achieve beautiful background<br/>illumination\u201d. <br/><br/>Smooth tough modern plastics are paired with signature teak handles creating Cocoon.",
