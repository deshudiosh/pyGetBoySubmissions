"description_html": "The feeling of coming home. On the sofa, in the evening after a long day. Over a glass of good wine or making conversation with friends. All priceless, valuable moments. <br/><br/>Tama Living is the perfect setting for such special moments. Its soft, elegant cushions spread out lavishly. The upholstered elements seem to float on subtle solid wood blades. It\u2019s all about symmetry, lines and surface, which set the structural rhythm of the sofa: gaps in the backrest lessen and minimize its sheer volume. Side tables featuring the best saddle leather pleasantly nestle up against the upholstery. And there is a special place for that glass of wine, too \u2013 not beside but within the sofa thanks to a built-in tray made of solid wood and saddle leather. Tama Living \u2013 an ingenious tune on a keyboard of hushed tones but also a piece of classical music. A composition for sophisticated living.",
