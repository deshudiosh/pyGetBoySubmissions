"description_html": "The myWall Inline Display System provides offices with an efficient, customizable and attractive design solution perfect for any office environment. Rooted in design cues derived from both Scandinavian and Japanese design, the high-quality myWall system is designed to provide owners and managers with the ability to make their office space both functional and design conscious. The unique system can be installed on existing walls or can create an entirely new space leveraging the multi-functional panels as freestanding walls. The double-sided panels offer twin functionality creating useful space on both sides of the wall and since all cabling can run between the panels there is no rewiring needed no matter how they are configured. The adaptability of the myWall system makes it the perfect solution to maximize the efficiency of any workplace including co-working spaces that are constantly looking to customize to varying requirements. Whether you are looking to create a traditional shared office space or outfit a tattoo parlor, we can create a custom version of myWall that works for you.",
