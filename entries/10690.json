"description_html": "The Lichen Collection by Mohawk Group is a new modular plank carpet system resulting from innovations that merge leading concepts in biophilic design and sustainability. Lichen is the first flooring product to achieve the International Living Future Institute\u2019s Living Product Challenge Petal Certification. Inspired by the idea of \u201cNature\u2019s Carpet,\u201d the design team looked at natural assemblages of rich multi-hued, multi-textured lichens from extreme climates as the foundation for the collection. <br/><br/>The anchor of the collection is a large-scale field of lichen \u201cblooms\u201d that change in shape and form by colorway. Other patterns include a transition style that has less bloom as well as a style that is solely textured ground. The styles can be used together as a system, or separately, depending on the desired configuration of texture and color. The creation and specifying of Lichen has a net positive impact for people and the environment, giving more resources back to the environment than the collection uses during its entire life cycle.",
