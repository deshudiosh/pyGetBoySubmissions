"description_html": "To suspend a solid slab of stone within the transparent planes of glass was the minimalist idea for the \u201chow fragile this love\u201d lounge chair that drove the design development of the whole project. While the use of stone represents strength and permanence it was important to retain the sense of delicateness and fragility of the overall look. <br/>To create the appearance of a solid slab, a sheet of tempered glass was laminated between two layers of onyx marble and then capped on all sides with miter joints and hand polished. Any form of hardware or visible connection would detract from the simplicity. The stone is glued directly to the glass using a UV bond.<br/>The end result is a chair that challenges our preconceived notions and expectations of what furniture should be. An object that surprises you with its unexpected comfort, with its unapparent strength; a piece that embraces tension to enhance and transform the commonplace into something meaningful.",
