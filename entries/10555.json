And because they are magnetic, each panel can be changed as often as you like. <br/>Each frame is constructed from aluminum and then fnished with a durable powder coated paint in a number of colors. PXL is available in two sizes: 9 Series (9\" x 9\") and 16 Series (16\" x 16\"). Using a combination of these frames, any arrangement can be constructed.",
