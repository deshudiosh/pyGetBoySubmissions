"description_html": "Designed to deflect sound waves and encourage uninterrupted focus, the QT Privacy Lounge Chair establishes both an individual and collaborative work hub for the modern worker. Using classic geometric lines gently curved at their peak to form the lounge\u2019s outer frame, the chair provides adequate space for one to two people. Its solid wood frame is enhanced by tufted upholstery, which gives the lounge an eye-catching tactile quality and a soft-to-the-touch finish. Crafted using 100% woven polyester fabric available in a range of Poppin\u2019s new maturated hues, including Blush, Gray, Dark Gray, Brick, Dark Blue, Teal, and Leaf Green, the lounge chair\u2019s aesthetic falls in line with today\u2019s sophisticated office spaces in need of semi-seclusion seating. QT\u2019s foam and fibre padding system provides additional comfort, while also establishing a noise barrier. Incorporating the design concepts of noise-reducing panels, the QT Privacy Lounge Chair provides users with a quiet oasis to complete tasks. The lounge\u2019s technological capabilities also extend to its assembly, which is completed easily, without tools. The design amd manufacturing teams and factory worked in close coordination to achieve this unprecedented ability by employing a hybrid structure of plywood panels with flexible PU corners. The base frame, foam and webbing are upholstered in one integral form, and the entire product assembly is made whole by hand-twisting the solid ash legs from below. <br/><br/>QT provides ample quiet time with quality materials and construction for a fraction of the cost, in stock and ready for quick ship. The seamless three-sided shroud comprising the sides and back unfolds from flat for efficient transport and dynamic assembly. Pair with Poppin's power outlet and matching ottoman for longer powered lounging, or Poppin's solid ash Spot table for a laptop and a mug of something warm to energize instead.",
