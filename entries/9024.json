"description_html": "Thalassa, Pretty Penny is one Valley Forge's top selling textiles of 2016/2017 and it's quite easy to see why. Thalassa'a pattern is an all-over textural masterpiece. Taking after its namesake, an ancient personification of the sea, Thalassa is reminiscent of the time and ocean-worn walls of ancient Greece.<br/>Soft chenille and shimmering warp yarns are just a couple of reasons why Thalassa is such an attractive textile. The luminous yarns woven into the background create an ideal setting for the muted brown chenille to radiate off of. Light silver and brown tones together create the perfect neutral-toned textile that is right on par with today's color trends. Although it is a traditionally heavier weight yarn, the chenille in Thalassa is light-weight enough to allow the fabric to keep a flowy, draped texture when hanging in the window.",
