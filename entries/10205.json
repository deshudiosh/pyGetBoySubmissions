You might use the same room for a morning conference call, impromptu lunch, a few short afternoon meetings and solo work time later on. One space can do that, or should\u2014and our Bluetooth Speaker helps make it happen.<br/><br/>Bluetooth isn\u2019t new to our lives, but why not take advantage of the convenience of this technology in today\u2019s work environments?
