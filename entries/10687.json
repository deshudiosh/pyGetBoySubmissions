"description_html": "Looking to Hollywood, which has entertained, engaged and inspired the world from the silver screen to the comfort of home since the 19th Century, McGuire Furniture sought to make big dreams a reality for the Spring 2017 collection with pieces steeped in glamour and refinement with an eye towards what\u2019s ahead. McGuire\u2019s designers used the core materials that have come to define the company over the past 70 years, along with the specialized craftsmanship that brings those materials to life in truly innovative ways. New shapes carved in rattan, bamboo seating, caning with a twist, brass bands, and shapely concrete make bold statements and create a cast of characters that are McGuire\u2019s future.<br/><br/>The Haybine Sling Lounge is a distinguished, masculine shape that mirrors the quadratic shapes and strong characters found in baling raw, natural substances. The geometric Blonde Brass frame is complete with a rich, sturdy leather sling and attached head pillow. A character in its own right, the Haybine Sling Lounge provides luxurious comfort and gallant strength. Comes standard in solid Blonde Brass frame and leather sling, backrest<br/>pillow, and arm covers available in Saddle, Rustic or Bison.",
