"description_html": "Taking a cue from the mid-century Danish designers, and building upon Gunlocke\u2019s legacy of wood craftsmen, Iris is an attempt to pay homage to a legacy of beautiful furniture designs. The Iris\u2019 curvilinear shape provides a much-needed balance when paired with rectilinear lounges and tables. <br/><br/>\u201cIris began as a line in my sketchbook,\u201d says designer principle Jim Barefoot. \u201cIt was sculpted and refined in my workshop. I pulled upon my skills as a woodworker and thought about the designers of Denmark. I likened myself and the talented staff of Gunlocke working side-by-side; continuing that tradition.\u201d <br/><br/>Comfort was of the utmost importance. The molded shell is designed to gently surround and support. The arms assist in getting in and out of the chair, but the slope provides elbow room. The natural, sculptural form, with a residential feel, is a companion to conventional lounges. It serves waiting areas, collaborative meeting spaces or a soft space for individual work. <br/><br/>Iris is available with a polished aluminum, four-star return to center base, turned maple or ash legs and ottoman. In addition, Iris can be specified in both a single and dual upholstery.",
