"description_html": "The Linn Collection is a unique, geometric design that is perfect for any application--from a nightstand to a bathroom cabinet knob, this hardware design is like jewelry for your door/drawer faces. <br/><br/>The Linn is milled out of solid brass right down the street from our studio in Los Angeles. Each piece is then carefully brushed by hand to give it a very soft, satin texture. The Linn will develop a rich, natural patina as the piece matures with age and use. <br/><br/>The Linn also comes in a black finish, which is milled out of solid aluminum and then anodized with a flat black finish. <br/><br/>Dimensions: <br/>Diameter / 1.25\"<br/>Projection / 1.25\"",
