"description_html": "Cubist and modern, Morro Bay\u2019s single-lever design is stylishly square without appearing clunky. Radically thinning the spout and creating an ultra-thin, planar \u201cfloating\u201d handle achieves the intended sleek and ethereal vision. <br/><br/>Morro Bay\u2019s \"floating\" handle, which operates completely independently of the faucet body, presents a groundbreaking design feature in the single-hole faucet category. Streamlined and elegantly modern, the handle gently sails above the body, versus moving along with a heavy, cumbersome hub. With its handle that operates as a \u201cfree spirit,\u201d Morro Bay creates the illusion of a thin, narrow rectangle balancing on end atop the faucet as if on a fulcrum. And by intentionally omitting the extraneous, the design exudes a Zen-like simplicity that makes Morro Bay as much a mini modern sculpture as it is a faucet. <br/><br/>As with all of California Faucets bath fittings, the Morro Bay single-lever faucet is constructed of solid brass and is available in more than 30 artisan finishes which include 15 PVD finishes that are guaranteed for life against tarnishing.",
