"description_html": "Master &amp; Dynamic continues its obsession with materials and technology with the creation of its first wireless speaker: the MA770. Co-designed by architect Sir David Adjaye, designer of the latest Smithsonian Museum \u2013 the National Museum of African American History and Culture \u2013 the MA770 Wireless Speaker\u2019s use of premium materials and components can be found throughout.<br/><br/>Comprised of a proprietary concrete composite \u2013 the result of Master &amp; Dynamic\u2019s passion for innovation with a variety of materials \u2013 the MA770\u2019s core material provides a number of acoustic benefits such as increased dampening, reduced resonance from the enclosure due to its single-mold build, a purer sound and added durability. The dampening properties of the concrete are so impressive \u2013 five times better than wood and ten times better than plastic \u2013 that the speaker can be placed just inches away from a turntable and play at full volume without causing the record to skip.<br/><br/>The MA770\u2019s sonic sophistication also stems from its dual 4\u201d woven kevlar long throw woofers and 1 \u00bd\u201d titanium tweeter powered by 100 watts of Class D amplification. The use of two smaller long throw kevlar woofers allows the MA770\u2019s drivers to react incredibly quickly, accurately delivering the punch and energy of the original artistry; the rigidity of the proprietary titanium tweeter also aides the speaker in delivering crystal clear sound. Tuning the MA770\u2019s sound profile was achieved with a laser doppler anemometer and hundreds of hours of listening to achieve harmony between the custom drivers and concrete enclosure.<br/><br/>The speaker's controls are crafted in diamond-cut anodized aluminum, while a magnetically-attached etched stainless steel grille serves to protect the speaker\u2019s componentry. The grille is removable for those that prefer the chic look of the exposed components to the grille\u2019s elegance. The speaker surprises and delights with sloping fine edges and triangular shapes that end with a gentle point on the speaker's unique back.<br/><br/>The MA770 can be controlled by four source options: Chromecast built-in, Bluetooth, analog (3.5mm) and optical. The MA770 can be used as a single stereo unit or paired with another speaker via Wi-Fi to provide a larger stereo image, enabling multi-room audio via Chromecast built-in. It is the first speaker to use this technology for stereo pairing. <br/><br/>Designed in New York City, the MA770 Wireless Speaker is created by pouring a proprietary concrete composite into a single-mold casing and allowing it to cure. The case is then hand-polished, giving each MA770 its own unique look. Once the outer case is complete, the speaker\u2019s various componentry is meticulously placed into the concrete casing via a discrete port located on the product\u2019s underbelly. Once sealed inside the single-mold concrete composite casing, the speaker is ready for use.<br/><br/>At 16in x 20in x 10in and 35lbs, the speaker is capable of filling a large room with sonically sophisticated sound, while its polished exterior is perfect for use in the home, office, gallery, or museum.",
