"description_html": "It is said that all good things come in threes and so the Twins family grows this year with the addition of a coquettish two-seater sofa, a loveseat in a very real sense. Because its compactness and small scale it is perfect for reduced spaces or cozy environments.<br/>The loveseat, just like the two original armchairs before, looks casual, but elegant, extremely contemporary and exquisitely finished. Equally concerned for aesthetics and functionality, it thus become a holistic design granting further resistance and comfort thanks to high quality materials.<br/>Its upholstery in OmegaTM Outdoor, a 3D mesh specifically developed by the Danish company Gabriel for Expormim, stretches beautifully upon the aluminum frame creating attractive visual effects. It is again a collection wholly suitable for outdoor, although its gentle lines and soothing colour palette allow for an easy and natural adaptation to interiors.<br/>Its structure is made of high resistance aluminum tube. Different colours are available: white, black, brown and champagne fine textured. 3D Mesh OmegaTM Outdoor comes in black, taupe, paprika and turquoise. A wide range of outdoor fabrics is also available for the seat pad and decorative cushions.",
