"description_html": "Velvet Elite brought for the first time into the market, thanks GD Arredamenti's expertise, a new manufactory technique for cabinet fronts called 3-layer: 3 thick panels of solid wood are glued and high-pressed together to create a 26mm (1inch) full-body, inflexible and durable solid-wood door. And today we push even further introducing a new finish, one of the most precious and elegant wood in nature: Canaletto walnut. Also known as Black walnut or American walnut, this rich wood with its distinctive texture combined with our 3-layer technology will create a state-of-art kitchen cabinet system for your house. GD Arredamenti prides itself on making kitchens that will outlive the homes in which they are placed.",
