"description_html": "Each blossom\u2014a unique, delicate arrangement. At once open and closed, the flower\u2019s light and shadow lure one into its contemplative depths.<br/><br/>Lure transforms a flower\u2019s transient beauty into a lasting light. In this fixture, a cast paper flowers are lit by suspended LEDs. Held by a slender brass arc, the light shines brightly on a blossom built of hand-sculpted petals, displaying texture, structure, and delicacy. The white flower reflects light, providing a source of soft illumination.<br/><br/>The Lure Chandelier uses cast paper flowers that are sculpted by hand in our studio. Each blossom\u2019s petals are individually shaped and each Lure blossom is unique. Unlike wood-based paper, the cotton paper is archival in quality, extremely durable, and has been known to last for more than a hundred years.<br/><br/>The Lure can be made into a pendant fixture, a wall sconce, or a chandelier.",
