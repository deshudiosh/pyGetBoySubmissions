"description_html": "Designed by Carole Baijings and Stefan Scholten and of Amsterdam-based Scholten &amp; Baijings, the ColourForm Sofa Group was inspired by the creative tensions between color and pattern, between surface and form, and between design and production that defines every project the designers undertakes. It is the perfect expression of its their artistic process.<br/><br/>Scholten &amp; Baijings is known for sculpting in pattern, texture, and color. When designing furniture, the designers consider the play of light and shadow, and the geometry of forms that comfortably host a variety of human postures. <br/><br/>Throughout their practice, the designers emphasize multiplicity and combination with their designs, and, in their ColourForm Sofa Group, the result is a vocabulary of multiple lounge seating pieces, including two- or three-seat sofas with or without arms, a club chair, ottoman, bench, sectional, and a distinctive t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate (an S-shaped piece that allows people to sit facing each other). <br/><br/>\u201cWe create options and possibilities because a product is produced and reproduced many times,\u201d notes Scholten. \u201cWe want to give a feeling to each one that it could be unique.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cAnd while we want to leave those choices and possibilities to the consumer in the end,\u201d adds Baijings, \u201cat the same time we like to show how it\u2019s nice to combine certain elements or selections to demonstrate how it all can work together.\u201d As intended, each piece of the ColourForm Sofa Group can stand alone or be combined with others to provide a place for work, play, or respite.",
