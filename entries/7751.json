"description_html": "When it comes to designing a flawless laminate, innovative technology needs to be infused from the very start of the manufacturing process, making it part of the product, not just an add-on. From pesky handprints to unsightly smudges, troublesome fingerprint marks have been the enemy of super-matte, silky-soft laminates in commercial installations, until now. New Wilsonart Traceless\u2122 Laminates infuse fingerprint-resistant technology into its super matte, velvety, soft surface making smudges of all shapes and sizes seem to disappear.<br/><br/>For a space to be truly practical, a surface should not require extra maintenance, which is why Traceless Laminates not only require less wiping down to get rid of smudges, but they hold the durability of Wilsonart Laminates. Meaning heat, impact and scratch resistance, and UL GREENGUARD Gold certification for low-chemical emissions comes standard.",
