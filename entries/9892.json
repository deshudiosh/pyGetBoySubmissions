"description_html": "The Muse rug in Earth is designed by Crosby Street Studios and is made from handspun Tibetan wool loop and silk cut pile. The Crosby Street Studios Design team explores different techniques ranging from the classic to the experimental\u2014from watercolor and gouache to painted plastic printed onto paper; crumpled aluminum foil, translated through photography; or some other spur-of-the-moment adventure in mixed media. The handwork in the design studio is just one touch of a larger, hand-to-hand, collaborative endeavor that involves the technique and artistry of yarn makers, dyers, weavers, and finishers from around the world. The design for Muse was inspired by artwork made of watercolor dyes on paper.",
