"description_html": "Inspired by the spokes of a bicycle wheel, this pendant lamp has a light yet solid structure resembling that of a birdcage or a lantern. A LED light is delicately placed inside the base of the cage, enabling light to direct upwards, reflecting through the metal rods while simultaneously casting intriguing shadow shapes to surrounding surfaces. <br/><br/>The unique shade consists of a series of softly curved steel wires that are powder coated, forming an oversized round shape, making it a durable yet a lightweight lamp that delivers impeccable design details. <br/><br/>The cleverly concealed LED points both downward, to directly illuminate surfaces, and upward, casting a moody interplay of light and shadow onto the walls.<br/><br/>New for 2017, Graphite and Copper are added to the existing colorways, bringing a metallic flare to the lamp that accommodates an array of residential and contract projects.",
