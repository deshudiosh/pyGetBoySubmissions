"description_html": "The shapes of Eddy draw their inspiration from the logic and styling of the cycling world, but also from the minimal and elemental graphic design of the fixie. \"If you think about it, many of the first prototypes in the history of design were made in cycling workshops\", explains Alain Gilles, \"because that's where the masters of tubular metal manufacturing were, and they had the expertise required to make those objects with such essential style\". The Eddy armchair is built using the same logic as bicycle construction, around a tubular metal frame, while the seat is designed to be comfortable and ergonomic. The way in which the various parts of the frame are connected - using \u201cquick release\u201d fittings - is an obvious reference to the cycling world.<br/>The use of separate elements to make up the frame of the armchair makes it possible to play with the graphics and thus create multiple combinations of different colours and finishes. The armrests can be embellished with side pockets which are useful for storing books and magazines or to keep remote controls within easy reach. Eddy is available with or without a headrest.<br/>Frame in metal, painted in a variety of colours<br/>Upholstery in leather or eco-leather<br/>Dimensions: L. 78 cm, D. 86 cm, H. 101 cm",
