"description_html": "The Bischu Hospitality Cabinet was designed with style and convenience in mind, while sojourning in a home away from home.<br/>The translucent watercolor peacock pattern printed on cleanable, scratch-proof acrylic is reminiscent of classic chinoiserie wall covering. It wraps three sides of the cabinet and creates an off-the-wall piece of art for the guest room.<br/>Upon opening this artistic piece of furniture, the interior is outfitted to meet the needs of the most discerning guest; location for mini-fridge with vented back, sliding shelf for coffee and or tea maker, convenience outlet with grounded plug and USB, drawer for amenities, clear glass shelves for glassware and a mirrored back bar.<br/>In addition, the Bischu is fully customizable, from the exterior artwork, finish and interior specifications to the addition of bells and whistles such as lighting and sound.",
