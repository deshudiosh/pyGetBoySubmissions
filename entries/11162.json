Many of the designs are deft adaptations from the designer\u2019s own photography.<br/><br/>This initial launch of the collection, titled Salar, numbers twenty unique designs and 132 SKU\u2014many colors in each pattern. The first spark of inspiration for them arose during Jiun Ho\u2019s travels in South America, specifically to the salt flats and deserts of Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile, with their strikingly colored red lakes, flamingos, skies, and pampas.<br/><br/>The materials range from linen to cotton, velvet, chenille, and satin, using fibers of the highest quality, and can be used in a variety of applications, from window treatments to furniture upholstery. In the manufacturing, Jiun Ho is closely collaborating with leading mills in Italy and beyond.<br/><br/>The collection will soon grow to encompass many more unique designs, grouped into families based on the geographical region of their inspiration. It will include hundreds of distinct colorways, including many different neutrals, allowing for innumerable color combinations.",
