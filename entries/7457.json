The chair's tough frame is crafted in welded stainless steel with a matte finish. The chair's seat and armrests are solid North American hardwood; thermally modified ash with a coating of organic rosewood seed oil. The CHEVY CHASE CAFE CHAIR is sustainable because it will have an exceptionally a long life-cycle. Further, the stainless steel is recyclable, and likely began as recycled material . The wood is natural ash salvaged from a blighted forest. No toxic materials, glues, coatings or processes go into its manufacture. The chair is intentionally \"style-neutral\" so that it will work with both new and historic public spaces.",
