"description_html": "The Studio Collection designed by Richard Frinier in collaboration with Sunbrella\u00ae presents a refined yet approachable mix of graphic grid and linear patterns across uniquely layered textures. Architectural in structure with a soft hand, luxurious chenille yarns are woven into the mix creating a reflection of light and depth of texture seen only in the most compelling of textile designs. <br/><br/>Space, Studio, Urban, Graphic, City and Cityscape make up the collection to suggest easy-to-style textile design solutions that are subtly infused with the open, light-filled and balanced characteristics that draw us to modern urban living spaces. Use individually or as correlates to create experiential design that embraces the complex network that links all people and places together. <br/><br/>Sunbrella textiles minimize their environmental impacts based on solid and forward thinking business and sustainability practices, including: reduction in energy, water, material and waste consumption and further reduces waste through its unique take back program, Recycle My Sunbrella. They are Greenguard status and Greenguard Gold Certified. Superior performance textiles uniquely for interior and exterior residential projects. High-performance characteristics. UV- and fade resistant. Mold and mildew resistant.",
