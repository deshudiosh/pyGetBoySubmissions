"description_html": "Fantini is pleased to introduce Fontane Bianche, the fruit of their long artistic collaboration with Salvatori, the Italian design company renowned for its skill in transforming stone into beautiful textures. The two companies\u2019 shared passion for excellence and desire to blend creativity and technology brought them together for a completely original expression of water in metal and marble.<br/><br/>Designed by Elisa Ossino, Fontane Bianche stunningly fuses the natural elements of stone and water. The design arose from research into archetypal forms, such as in Greek mythology, which were then translated into geometric precision and reinterpreted in a contemporary vein. A dialogue between circle and square runs through the entire collection \u2013 a metaphor for the relationship between psyche and material. <br/><br/>The washbasin, for example, is created from a square marble block, from which a circular hemisphere is extracted. Featuring a slim, curved 90 degree shape, the tap is evocative of the radius of the washbasin itself, and the controls reference once more the relationship of circle and square.<br/><br/>The purity of the forms is embellished by rich materials \u2013 marble and stone for the washbasins and gun metal finish for the taps. Translated as \u201cWhite Fountain,\u201d Fontane Bianche takes its name from an area with white sands in Sicily, so-called on account of numerous natural freshwater fountains gushing out of the sea.",
