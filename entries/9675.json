The induction cooktop offers the most powerful single burner in the industry, thanks to the exclusive Power Boost feature: a 5,500 Watts burner can bring one gallon of water in a large pot to a rolling boil in only three and half minutes.<br/>The seamless two burner bridging technology is perfect for grilling or searing with the unique dual zone plancha/grill, sold separately.
