"description_html": "In the world of contract furniture, every day brings a new product. With Rapt Studio\u2019s first collection, we chose to bring to the forefront a series of products that would fill a niche for the needs of our clients. We wanted to bring a simple, non-directional aesthetic that is customizable, to assure the products would be at home in any environment. The Table collection comes in two heights. <br/><br/>Saddle-Up is a stand-up version for impromptu meetings, discussions, or group work environments, while the Saddle-Down is a lower, tea-height, lounge version for that relaxed meeting space in which you also require a laptop. Both tables come with customizable legs in raw steel, powder coat or bronze, customizable tops in wood, concrete or stone, and a bespoke leather Saddle Bag to hold cables, wireless speakers, and incidentals for a fully supported gathering space.",
