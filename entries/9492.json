"description_html": "A printed fabric with 3D effect which plays with geometry and with color. It comes from the reproduction of a contemporary embroidery which, once produced by digital printing on a white linen ground, becomes a sort of textile trompe l\u2019oeil: the embroidery, perfectly rendered, is in fact illusory in that this is a printed fabric. The overlaps and interweaving of color are very interesting. Suitable for heavy use, it is available in 5 colors.",
