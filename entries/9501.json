"description_html": "Indigo is our most dynamic and colorful floor yet. This lustrous color is achieved by washing wide plank American Ash floor with plant based Indigo dye. Three coats of carefully applied dye transform this otherwise light colored wood into a deep blue reminiscent of a midsummer night sky. The more porous early wood absorbs more of the dye creating a stark contrast in the already lively ash grain. Once stained, the boards are then finished and sealed with a waterbourne polyurethane, locking in the color and adding a luminous, iridescent shimmer. <br/><br/>Dark and moody yet approachable and fun, this floor is anything but understated.",
