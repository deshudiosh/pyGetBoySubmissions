"description_html": "Moroccan Rose is an uber-sophisticated interpretation of a textile that could be found in a souk or market in Marrakech. It is a delicate ethnic textile design featuring rich hues of Moroccan spices, the Mediterranean Sea and North African sky. Rich, raised, saturated colors are woven atop earthy ground colors in a finely designed pattern fashioned after the natural bounty and found objects associated with Africanate tribal cultures. Your projects will enjoy years of worry-free performance with Nomi\u2019s durable, UV and stain resistant, bleach- cleanable, anti-microbial textiles. Available through to-the-trade showrooms and directly through Nomi\u2019s design studio in Northern California. <br/><br/>Colors: Indigo, Coral, Celadon<br/>Width: 54\u201d Repeat: 7\u201dV 7\u201dH <br/>100% Solution Dyed Polyolefin <br/>Passes: NFPA#260 / CA#117 <br/>Abrasion: 70,000",
