The forms make a bold gesture and fill the needs of individual collaborative areas, atrium and reception areas, private office and casual conference spaces. Domino\u2019s arms are wide and low, providing a place for a computer or a casual place to sit and converse. Arms can be placed at the ends, at set intervals or along a run. An optional power/data module located in the front of the arm is ideally placed for ease of access.<br/><br/>Domino is very flexible with the extensive number of units and options that allow for limitless configurations adaptable to various workplace functions.
