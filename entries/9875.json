"description_html": "Our latest tile infatuation comes in the form of french reproduction Belgian Black terracotta tiles (available in 8\" squares &amp; hexagon &amp; star/cross). Take a restored form of modest terracotta production, only this time, substitute the standard terracotta with the most exquisite blackened clay. We call these tiles Belgian Black terracotta because they are perfect for grounding projects with the same austerity as striking Belgian antique surfaces.",
