"description_html": "Inspired by the simplicity of Nordic design, Duravit\u2019s new Luv collection merges subtlety with elegance. The Scandinavian-inspired series of washbasins, bathtubs, and bathroom furniture was designed by Cecilie Manz, who envisioned a \u201cbowl filled with water on a simple table\u201d to create the collection\u2019s signature shape.<br/><br/>The washbasins and bathtubs are equally modern and timeless, matching the trends of today and the classics of tomorrow thanks to a signature oval-shape. Luv\u2019s washbasins and tubs showcase Duravit\u2019s innovation and material expertise, with two proprietary materials used. The Luv washbasins are made from DuraCeram\u00ae, making them equally resilient and luxurious, and are perfected with generous inner basins and clean edges. The Luv bathtubs are seamlessly made from DuraSolid A, which gives the tubs a warm to the touch feel with a high-quality matte look. <br/><br/>Luv\u2019s color palette of matte lacquers and soft glazes was developed exclusively for this collection. The washbasin is available in a variety of neutral shades - including soft white, grey, and sand - that complement the graceful, refined aesthetic of the series.",
