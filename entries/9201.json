"description_html": "According to joint research conducted by Steelcase and Microsoft Corp., creativity is seen as a critical job skill driven by organizations\u2019 need for innovation and growth in addition to employees\u2019 desire for meaningful work. However, many organizations invest in technology and space as separate entities rather than approaching them holistically. This lack of cohesion creates sub-optimal conditions for fostering creativity. People need to work alone, in pairs and in different size groups throughout a creative process, and they need a range of devices that are mobile and integrated into the physical workplace. Additionally, spaces should inspire people without compromising performance. <br/><br/>Together, Steelcase and Microsoft have joined forces to explore the future of work, developing a range of technology-enabled Creative Spaces designed to help organizations foster creative thinking and better collaboration. This ecosystem of spaces seamlessly integrates the best of Microsoft Surface devices with Steelcase architecture and furniture. They include a Maker Commons, Respite Room, Focus Studio, Ideation Hub and Duo Studio. Each of the Creative Spaces is intentionally designed to support the needs of individuals and teams as they move through the different stages and activities of the creative process.",
