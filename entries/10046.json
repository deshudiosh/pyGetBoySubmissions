"description_html": "Roc is a generously shaped easy chair. It conveys a sense of security, but does without voluminous amounts of material. Dispensing with the ample dimensions of a winged armchair, its highly modern, somewhat minimalistic design vocabulary is representative of a new generation of upholstered easy chairs. Roc's round back section flows outwards in gently curved armrests, the upholstered body with its slightly convex seat cushion rests on a rounded, smaller base. Another positive feature is that the new individual easy chair is comparatively light, making relocation within the room effortless. Available in fabric and leather, also as a swivel chair.",
