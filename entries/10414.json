"description_html": "The Frank chair balances geometrically purity, plush comfort and robust engineering. Two perfectly round cushions float uncannily above the frame for ideal support and maximum visual impact. The draftsman's hand can be felt in the delicate, linear structure that envelopes the softly upholstered seat and back. Both Modern and Moderne the Frank chair owes a debt to early 20th-century design experiments in mathematical clarity. At once delicate and daring this three-legged chair stands out on its own.<br/><br/>Luxurious yet durable mohair fabric. Meticulously crafted, brushed brass frame with hand-worked finish. Molded polyurethane foam fill for maximum support and comfort.",
