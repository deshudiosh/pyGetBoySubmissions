"description_html": "The Bower Collection is Adam Goodrum\u2019s first collection for the commercial market and includes a work station, armchair, meeting lounge and a range of adjustable screens. The collection is inspired by the rambling-style nests created by the bowerbird, the Bower Collection is open, organic and gentle, bringing a natural and calm aesthetic to the workplace. The vertical woven elements of Bower appear to be groving like vines. The architecture of this design also controls acoustics as the undulting shapes catch and absorbs noise.<br/><br/>Adam Goodrum is a firm beliver that every environment is defined by the objects within it, he designs with the philosophy that an object must therefore justify its existence - through its story and detailing. For this reason, his designs celebrate process and craftmanshift, and accentuate components and joinery to create functional pieces with spirit and personality.",
