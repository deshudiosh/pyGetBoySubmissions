"description_html": "PFRM is an energetic upholstery collection from Carnegie with product design consulting by Gensler. The designs take inspiration from the strength, durability and boldness of modern athletic apparel. The seven-pattern collection aims to deliver function, comfort and durability through high-performance material technology.<br/><br/>Activity and wellness are weaving their way into creative spaces for work, play and living. Our everyday spaces are increasingly being designed to encourage collaboration, connectivity and even competition -- PFRM\u2019s upbeat hues, patterns and sportswear-inspired textures are a response to this trend. These performance fabrics complement an array of settings.<br/><br/>The collection incorporates innovative knit technologies to each textile, namely in the ways fabrics surpass flexibility and durability goals while maintaining their distinct aesthetic. <br/><br/>Stride\u2019s open net pattern is first knitted and then laminated onto a flexible stretch base fabric. Instead of the conventional polyester fiber, the fabric uses a natural matte wool as the top layer to juxtapose onto the shimmering poly-based backing, creating an unique and unexpected texture. <br/><br/>Pivot and Flex integrate a knit technology that makes the designs flexible when upholstered on round forms and different curves. Pivot is precision-engineered to endure intensive stretch and create a unique look when upholstered on seats, pillows and panels.",
