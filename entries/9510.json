"description_html": "Designed for the modern, active workstation, Infinity is a new LED task light from Humanscale that responds to evolving tasks and needs. This 2017 Red Dot Product Design winner offers exceptional flexibility and high quality, energy-efficient light. Its constant torque \u2018Forever Hinge\u2019 allows for seamless adjustment, so the user<br/>can easily re-position the light to accommodate varying needs and comfort levels throughout the day. These innovative new hinges promise to withstand frequent use and maintain their secure positioning over time. <br/><br/>Infinity uses large-array, multi chip LEDs to achieve 1500 lux illumination that casts just a single shadow. It is composed of 90% highly recyclable aluminum, and because the light\u2019s exterior color is created by color films (rather than paint) the manufacturing process to create unique colors remains streamlined, and<br/>therefore more energy efficient. Rated for 50,000 hours and featuring cool chip performance, Infinity provides the ideal task light output that\u2019s powerful yet eco-friendly. Additional user-friendly features include a nightlight mode and a PIR sensor to conserve energy. User control indicator lights fade after adjustment to reduce visual<br/>clutter. Offering an infinite number of adjustments and the latest LED technology, Infinity is designed for long-term performance.",
