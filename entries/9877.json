"description_html": "The Dew rug in Relic is made from hand-spun Tibetan wool and silk Soumak with a raised cut pile design that can be custom colored. Crosby Street Studios design team explores different techniques that range from the classic to the experimental\u2014from watercolor and gouache to painted plastic printed onto paper; crumpled aluminum foil, translated through photography; or some other spur-of-the-moment adventure in mixed media. The handwork in the design studio is just one touch of a larger, hand-to-hand, collaborative endeavor that involves the technique and artistry of yarn makers, dyers, weavers, and finishers from around the world. The design for Dew started as a painting of watercolor on plastic and the paint pooled up in random dots like morning dew forming on a glass window.",
