"description_html": "Zenzero Bench has issued a new edition in hand carved solid American Black Walnut planks supported by Polished Nickel Brass Legs. <br/>Inspired in the wake of Hurricane Sandy to make furniture from downed trees, the process has evolved to become a strong residential accent piece. Walnut planks are glued to form a large volume that is then hand carved to shape a long seat with a partial backrest. The body is supported by water jet cut steel legs that are finished in Polished Nickel Brass. The organic form floats above a series of legs and is capped on each side with a unique leg shape that sits flush with the wood.",
