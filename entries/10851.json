"description_html": "Bandas Space is a playful line of rugs with unlimited flexibility. Use them alone, place them end to end for a long runner or mix and match patterns to create wider rugs with unique designs. Crafted of 100 percent wool and embellished with a variety of decorative techniques, Bandas Space brings warmth and comfort to the workplace.<br/><br/>With BANDAS, designer Patricia Urquiola brings the modular concept to its very limits. The collection started off with the creation of long and fine rugs, embroidered by craftswomen in India. Used to working in a sitting position with their work on their laps, these women were not accustomed to producing pieces wider than 60cm. But what at first seemed like a limitation eventually became an opportunity. That\u2019s how the idea for modular rugs came about: runners of different designs joined together with Velcro straps on the sides. This way, each composition is truly unique and can adapt to any layout.",
