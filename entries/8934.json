"description_html": "Echo Glass is Nathan Allan Glass Studios newest kiln formed decorative glass creation. Wavelike patterns of Echo flutes are formed without texture, and the sweeping curves in the pattern bring a calm sense to any environment. Using exclusive Free Forming glass procedures, Echo Glass provides a wonderful visual appeal, while also creating a light distortion and shadowing effect. These features allow for ample light transmissions without sacrificing privacy. Echo Glass will illuminate any space in reverberating fashion.<br/>Our highly motivated factory team of glass artists and technicians, produced custom molds that met the challenges of a bold and organic pattern. Forming handmade glass with a very deep, swirling pattern, is difficult enough in itself. Creating a design which flows seamlessly from panel to panel, magnifies the difficulty by about 10 fold. The creation of 5 large panels, installed side x side, where the pattern flows continuously, is a spectacular accomplishment. Adding to the extreme difficulty in formed the 5 Echo panels is the formation of flat edges on the vertical seams, which allows the panels to fit tightly together, creating the seamless vision of the swirling Echo pattern. \u201cFlat Margins\u201d, as we prefer to name them, also aid the installation crew in lining up the panels on a straight edge, providing an easy platform to inserts a small bead of silicone between the panels.<br/>The Flutes in our Echo glass pattern are perfectly clear, without texture, yet with a deep Convex shaped 3D surface. The 3-Dimensional surface creates waves which flow from panel to panel, magnifying the effect of each wave. Enjoy the way our Echo Glass playfully partitions a space, yet allows for maximum light transmission. Echo Glass also casts shadows of waves on the walls behind the panels, bringing the energy and replenishing presence of nature into the most sophisticated of modern or industrial spaces. Echo Glass panels illuminate one of the startling mysteries of physics and light\u2019s dual nature as both particle and wave. Visible from all vantage points, Echo\u2019s rippling undulations brilliantly capture, recast and reflect light.<br/>Now part of our Freeform collection, Echo Glass panels are used to create open-air privacy sound screens. These panels also define and partition rooms while enriching natural light, and creating a jewel-like feature in any space. Echo Glass is fully safety tempered, with a 5/8\u201d pattern depth, and smooth monolithic polished edges. Just as the sunlight moves through the crystal-clear ocean or lake water, these stunning decorative panels create the impression of movement in stillness, and of stillness in movement.<br/>Parallel Designs, Wavy Fluted Streams, or however one chooses to describe it, Echo Glass is sending vibes throughout the Decorative Glass community. With 3\u201d wide, deep swirling flutes formed into each glass panel, and with molds produced to create a seamless, continuous flowing pattern, from panel to panel, Echo Glass has become a popular selection for discerning interior designers and their clients.<br/>Only available at Nathan Allan!",
