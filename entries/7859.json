"description_html": "Designed exclusively for AVENUE ROAD, The Mainkai Floor Lamp and Table Lamp by Sebastian Herkner draw on the curving Main river and the Quay or Kai that runs at its side through Frankfurt where he studied, and Offenbach, where he works today. Mouth-blown opaline shades sit atop a Spanish Marble base, mimicking the mooring buoys in constant motion with the ebbs of the changing tides. This same motion is simulated by a simple touch of the dimming switch on the stem of the fixture. <br/>The design reflects Herkner\u2019s mastery in combining new technologies with traditional craftsmanship in order to highlight the multifaceted beauty of the materials, and to draw renewed attention to every detail. The Mainkai Floor Lamp and Mainkai Table Lamp are part of the ongoing collaboration between AVENUE ROAD and Sebastian Herkner which began in 2013.",
