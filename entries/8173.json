"description_html": "Designed for HBF by Nao Tamura, Kanso addresses communal space -- a place to sit, work, and share in conversation -- yet stands on its own as an inspirational piece. Kanso is an example of beautiful forms meeting necessary functions and is designed to suit the way people work and lounge today. Thanks to Tamura's innovative vision and HBF's manufacturing and engineering expertise, Kanso is an all-new way to sit, work, and engage. <br/><br/>The collaborative piece enables multiple workers to use Kanso to their liking, employing the various benches and platforms to act as tables or seating. Kanso is perfect for today's modern, ever-changing work setting - it is well-suited for meetings with colleagues, solo brainstorming, or lunching and happy hour. The key to Kanso\u2019s versatility is its allowance for various postures, including sitting, lounging, and leaning.<br/><br/>Kanso (meaning \"simplicity\" in Japanese) references key elements of Japanese design, such as the Shoji Screen (a screen that moves back and forth), Tatami Mat (a flat floor mat), and Gabuton (square cushion for sitting). Exceptionally considered engineering keeps the aesthetic of Kanso extremely light and sophisticated. It has a metal base and high density foam cushions for lasting shape and support. The visual simplicity was an extremely important and intentional element, insuring that Kanso\u2019s design does not overwhelm any space. Kanso fits into a modern lifestyle, with a minimal design aesthetic that could only be accomplished thanks to HBF's design and craft expertise.",
