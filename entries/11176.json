"description_html": "The \" Giza \" chair was created for a charity event that benefited The Illumination Foundation in Orange County, California. When I was asked by Lux Magazine if I would create a seat to end homelessness, I immediately accepted the offer. The Giza chair is inspired by the Illumination foundation's logo, which is a triangle. The chair is a symbol of illumination, enlightenment and unity with the brass detailing representing ray of sunlight. The triangle being the foundation's commitment and strength to help our community and the brass is the ray of light in all those families and children's faces. <br/>I named it 'Giza', as it also reminds me of the pyramids due to it's triangular nature.<br/><br/>The material of the chair is American Beech stained and lacquered brass. The upholstery is 100% Linen.",
