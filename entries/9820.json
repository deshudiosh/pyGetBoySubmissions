In 9 colors.<br/><br/>Hinson\u2019s collection for Fall 2017 takes inspiration from City Island, the charming waterside village located just minutes from Manhattan. Boats bob in the harbor as waves lap gently on the shore; all while visitors crowd the promenades, beach, shingled shops and restaurants. CITY ISLAND Collection combines coastal ease, urban sophistication and year-round style, as would suit the remarkable enclave which enjoys both marine and skyline views. Colorful weaves, captivating embroideries, and a single dramatic print readily mix and match; a signature of the Hinson brand. Outdoor product makes its debut, all of which has been carefully designed to look and feel soft and comfortable for performance/indoor usage as well. Taken all together, the collection offers a virtual day trip to this unique and beautiful spot. Designers are sure to delight in exploring CITY ISLAND Collection, just as New Yorkers have always enjoyed visiting the breezy haven for which it\u2019s named.",
