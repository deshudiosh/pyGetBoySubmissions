"description_html": "The large scale, visually-striking lounge chair, Luno, was designed by, Austrian trio, EOOS. The hard, precise outer shell and inviting, wide seat were designed to allow for a variety of postures -- allowing the user to sink-in and find the most comfortable position for their needs and to support better non-verbal communication.<br/><br/>The Luno chair is a \u201cpower-seat.\u201d A commanding lounge chair that provides respite or, when used in conjunction with other seating, can create a high-energy, intuitive communication space. Because Luno incorporates movement and various postures, it supports non-verbal communication through body language.<br/><br/>The commanding form and style of Luno is a by-product of its unique design process. Rather than starting with the desired three dimensional object, the chair\u2019s shape was planned using two-dimensional cut pieces. These two-dimensional patterns were then folded together to create volume and shape from tension. The end result is a balance of lines, weight and form.<br/><br/>Luno is available in high or low back, and can be upholstered in any Keilhauer textile, COM or COL; up to two textiles can be selected to cover the exterior shell and cushioned interior. Ash hardwood, steel and exaggerated curves allow Luno to complement many other Keilhauer pieces - making it a flexible statement piece that can be added to existing or new spaces. Luno\u2019s 4-star steel base is available in Polished Aluminum, Dark Grey or Bronze. The Ash hardwood base is available in 10 different colors or solid Walnut - making it easy to adapt the piece to varying style preferences and create a seamless design aesthetic<br/><br/>Luno is designed to help create and maintain environments of wellness. Keilhauer furniture is built to the highest environmental standards to help create healthy spaces. Juxta is expected to carry BIFMA level\u00ae 2 and SCS Global Services certification for Indoor Air Quality at the Indoor Advantage\u2122 Gold level.<br/><br/>PRODUCT DIMENSIONS<br/>High back chair: W 36.75\u201d x D 32.5\u201d x H 41.5\u201d , SH 16\u201d, AH 23.75\u201d <br/>Low back chair: W 36.75\u201d x D 32.5\u201d x H 29\u201d , SH 16\u201d, AH 23.75\u201d",
