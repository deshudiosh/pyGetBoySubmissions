"description_html": "A collaboration with Creation Baumann, Carnegie\u2019s newest window solution, Entrada, is an innovative product reducing noise while providing a modern aesthetic. <br/><br/>Entrada is a unique offering that can act as a drapery and a hanging panel solution, possessing acoustical capabilities while bringing privacy to interiors. The textile is first cut by laser and then sewn into a three-dimensional structure, with the structural relief creating an intriguing interplay of light and shade.<br/><br/>The fabric, which resembles a fine wool felt, is crafted of 100% Trevira CS Polyester, passing the most stringent fire codes. The 47\" width by 118\" length panel has a NRC of 0.45 when draped flat and a NRC of 0.65 when draped at 100% fullness. It is offered in six colorways ranging from a selection of grey and stone hues to a rich plum and olive.<br/><br/>This sound-absorbing fabric demonstrates Carnegie\u2019s strength in creating solution-driven contract textiles with a strong design element. The textile can be easily applied in workplace settings such as corridors and circulation areas.",
