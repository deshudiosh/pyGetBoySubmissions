"description_html": "With a consummate simplicity of both line and material, Strata by Yabu Pushelberg explores the technical limitations of glass and plays with its most fundamental qualities.<br/><br/>The curved glass legs offer a sense of perceived lightness while asymmetrically supporting a touch-latch drawer, completely enclosed in milky white tempered glass. The top also features a milled casing to house either cables or a double-faced mirror which, when inserted, transforms this elegant desk into a contemporary vanity. <br/><br/>Equally at home as a console table, vanity or elegant desk, this multi-purpose tour de force is as simple as it is dramatic.",
