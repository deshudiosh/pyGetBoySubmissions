"description_html": "Made in Kufstein, Austria, the Fatto a Mano Series is the first of its kind to fuse the delicate art of mouth-blown crystal with the high-end accuracy and precision of machine-blown crystal. The colored stems and bases are hand-made by Riedel\u2019s glassblowers in the colorful Venetian glassblowing tradition, while the varietal specific bowls of each glass are machine-blown. The bowl and stem are then fused together by hand while the crystal is in a molten stage. <br/><br/>The new glassware line will be available in six stem colors: black, blue, green, red, yellow and white; and in six varietal-specific shapes, for Cabernet, Old World Pinot Noir, Old World Syrah, Oaked Chardonnay, Riesling and Champagne. Each glass will be sold individually ($100) allowing one to build an entire glassware collection in one color or add hints of different colors for each varietal.",
