"description_html": "The Zephyr is an example of what is possible today in \u201csculptural lighting\u201d. Our makers translate our designers' sketches and maquettes from a 2-D sheet of steel into a sculptural, 3-D form that brings a warmth into a space. An organic, elegant shape flows through the design of the Zephyr LED fixture. The heat-textured, artisan-forged steel morphs into the light guide, made of a seemingly flowing, ribbon-like, hand-shaped acrylic with a laser etched pattern that consistently draws the light from end-to-end, beautifully illuminating the Zephyr\u2019s fine details. This adjustable, cable-hung LED fixture is offered in a choice of 8 finish options. <br/><br/>The hallmark of Hubbardton Forge lighting is design that is graceful and unembellished, allowing the materials and forms to speak for themselves. A continuous exploration of both understanding and pushing the limits of form and materials inspires us to create designs that beautifully meld artistry and functionality.<br/><br/>Hubbardton Forge combines time-honored forging techniques with elegant design and the latest LED technology. All of our products are made-to-order, in Castleton, Vermont. We make products where the craftsmanship and skill clearly show. Any piece leaving the Forge is touched by multiple hands throughout the process of its creation. When you look at a Hubbardton Forge lighting fixture, you're seeing the artistic achievements of a team dedicated to design.",
