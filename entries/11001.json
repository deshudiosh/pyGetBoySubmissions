"description_html": "Jeff Andrews adds three architecturally inspired lounge chairs to his collection for A. Rudin. This is the first addition to the 20-piece array since the collaboration debuted in spring 2015. <br/>Each piece is unique, defined more by their sturdy, architectural frames than upholstery. The three chairs share a mid-century influence, resulting in pieces equally handsome, subtle and cozy. Chair 861 appears to float on a reclined frame, while 862 features an Andrews-signature structural back, and blends subtle curves and angles artfully. <br/>Andrews says, \u201cI started sketching pieces to add to my furniture collection with A. Rudin with an architectural intent. I love to put a pencil to paper and experiment with shape, scale and proportion. The trial and error of the creative process is key to designing pieces that feel original and relevant but are also versatile and comfortable.\u201d <br/>Andrews built his relationship with the A. Rudin family over many years of specifying and customizing their broad range of furniture for his design clients. Because of their mutual respect and shared vision, the Jeff Andrews Collection for A. Rudin was born. The creative journey between designer and manufacturer has been intimate, exploratory and fulfilling, resulting in the perfect expression of the designer\u2019s own personal aesthetic.",
