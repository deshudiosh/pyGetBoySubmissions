"description_html": "Mayer introduces the Stitch Collection, designed by Jeremy Noonan, and created in collaboration with the Common Thread for the Cure Foundation, Valdese Weavers and Crypton, LLC. Examples of stitching, patching, and layering are mending techniques that can be found throughout the history of textiles. The \"Stitch\" Collection takes its inspiration from the tradition of repairing and renewal. This assortment of healthcare centric upholstery and privacy curtain fabrics celebrates the resiliency and restorative qualities of the human spirit. Each of Noonan's designs was inspired by an original textile artifact. The pattern designs in the Stitch Collection are characterized by the use of linear elements (connection), texture (touch), and textile heritage (history). The constructions were engineered to create an artisanal look and feel that emulate the handmade textile references. The collection consists of six seating fabrics: Darning, Crazy Quilt, Kantha, Running Stitch, Saori and Boro; along with two privacy curtain fabrics: Friendship Quilt and Embellished. Proceeds from sales that result from the collaboration will be donated to the Common Thread for the Cure Foundation's Helping Hand Grants program to support those persons or their families within our industry who have breast cancer. It can be used to meet financial obligations, household needs, transportation to doctor\u2019s appointments, etc. The collection will feature C-Zero Plus Moisture Barrier, Crypton's non-fluorinated performance option.",
