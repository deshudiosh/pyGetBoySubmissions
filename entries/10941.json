"description_html": "The Composed faucet collection by Kohler is a design stripped of nonessential flourishes. Its elements were repeatedly refined and reduced to achieve poise and purpose from the most compact form. The classic, clean look of Composed embodies simplicity with quiet confidence, and the rich, deep tone of the Titanium finish adds an element of allure to the collection. Intended to delight in detail whatever its role within the interior, this collection is part of Kohler\u2019s commitment to growing its global contemporary offering.<br/><br/>A striking complement to vessel sinks, this tall single-handle faucet features a top-mounted joystick to control water flow and temperature. Joystick handle makes a distinct visual statement with unique actuation. KOHLER ceramic disc valves exceed industry longevity standards for a lifetime of durable performance. Temperature memory allows faucet to be turned on and off at any temperature setting.",
