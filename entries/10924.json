"description_html": "Kohler freestanding baths provide homeowners a way to make a front-and-center statement of personal design and style within the bathroom space. Veil's flowing and immaculately balanced curves evoke a sculpted simplicity in tune with contemporary style. This Veil freestanding bath offers a luxuriously deep bathing experience with supportive contours that cradle your body. <br/>Always striving to live on the leading edge, Kohler launches these hand-crafted baths from KOHLER Lithocast cast resin material, a premium high-gloss material that allows for new geometries, textures and designs, including the visually striking thin walls for these new baths. Each bath is carefully shaped from one, solid piece, ensuring structural integrity, and the lightweight material allows for easier transport and on-site installation of the bath. Kohler carefully considers ergonomic details and consumer experiences with every bath. Kohler freestanding baths provide deep soaking wells to help bathers unwind. Lumbar supports are engineered to accommodate a wide range of body types. And the slope of Kohler baths facilitates both a comfortable upright position as well as a relaxing lounge position, which enables you to bathe exactly how you want.",
