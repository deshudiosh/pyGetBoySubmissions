"description_html": "With the Isabella Sofa, Frank Ponterio designed an integral arm rest that, no matter a person\u2019s height, they will feel supported. \"Often with a higher arm rest, a person can feel awkward, but this design element adds comfort without bulk,\" says Ponterio. \"It was meant to solve a problem. The piece is 'masculine but pretty,' a phrase I quite like, offering an adaptable and accessible feel that works in a variety of settings and aesthetics.\" The welt around the back of the sofa means it can \u201cfloat\u201d in a space and that it looks good from all angles.",
