            "description_html": "Shift magazine is a publication from J+J Flooring Group designed to spark innovative and inspiring out-of-the-box design perspectives in commercial flooring applications using the J+J product portfolio. Shift embraces the idea that every floor installation is a blank canvas from which to create a distinct design and broaden perspectives. Shift explores conceptual approaches using a progressive combination of pattern, color and texture. With its focus on design and inspiration, the publication features artistically intriguing images that capture imagination and possibility. Gracefully integrating J+J product and installation configuration options alongside thought-provoking photo vignettes, Shift is at once both a practical resource and an inspirational guide. <br/><br/>New editions of Shift are published throughout the year and each include a series of exploratory concepts which will shift perspectives to provide new ideas in the application of commercial floor covering. <br/><br/>In Volume one of \u201cShift,\u201d \u201cHighlight\u201d explores the utilization of thoughtfully placed color accents to create a memorable design them, \u201cSync\u201d artfully shows how function and flair can be achieved by pairing relevant floor types within a singular space and, \u201cFresh\u201d reveals new perspectives on merging patterns with color create intentional focus on space, function and direction. <br/><br/>The second volume of \u201cShift\u201d, titled Hyperbole, presents the striking splendor of exaggerated color and creativity, bold decisions and beautiful statements. Embracing the idea that exaggeration in the right moment and space perhaps isn\u2019t exaggeration at all, this volume of \u201cShift\u201d takes on an inspiration of perfect overstatements, extravagance of pattern and texture, tone and color, movement and emotion. Over and over, this volume of \u201cShift\u201d asks the question: is too much ever too much?<br/><br/>Volume 3, titled \"Simpatico\", will make its debut in October 2017. <br/><br/>In addition to the printed Shift publications, J+J has implemented a Shift visualizer tool in which designers can view featured Shift flooring designs in room scenes, download and share images and easily order packaged samples of their favorite shift palettes.",

And so Spec Cheque was born.<br/><br/>Designed to occupy minimal shelf space while delivering maximum resources to a design library, the system is comprised of a series of \u2018Spec Cheque\u2019 Books: one for chairs, one for tables, one for soft seating, and so on. Each is filled with a collection of Spec Cheques that provide images and a brief description of the company\u2019s products, one per \u2018Cheque.\u2019 The chair Cheque Book, for example, has nearly 60 individual Cheques. Each details a featured product with attractive photos and construction facts, information that designers appreciate having when working on a project.<br/><br/>The term \u201cSpec Cheque\u201d was conceived to combine the concept of a \u201cspecification\u201d \u2014 model, assembly, materials, finish, upholstery, accessories, etc. \u2014 with the need to verify (hence, \u201ccheck\u201d) the details. The European spelling of Cheque was used to emphasize the company\u2019s multinational heritage while simultaneously amplifying the dimensions of the promotional piece. It actually looks like an oversized check.<br/><br/>Each Cheque is punched and held in place by aluminum rings in a binder. Perforations create a stub so the Cheque can be detached while the stub remains in the Cheque Book, to remind the user that one of the Cheques is missing and needs to be replaced. At the same time, the detached Cheque can be mailed, pinned to a tack board, placed on a presentation board, hung from a sample, or distributed during casual meetings. The entire package is environmentally friendly too. The Cheque Book is just pressboard \u2013 no vinyl cover \u2013 and the Cheques are coated with an aqueous finish that makes them completely biodegradable.<br/><br/>California-based graphic artist Glenn Barry \u2014 who has created a range of upscale solutions for major clients including Walt Disney Studios, Air Bud Entertainment and Studio A Records \u2014 was the lead designer on the project.",

Fabrics in Makers incorporate the performance qualities of Sunbrella with authentic designs tied to generations of makers. The collection portrays the importance of preserving the conventional element of craft while advancing technologically. By combining new, experimental techniques with traditional style, the artisan fabrics are perfectly suited for both indoor and outdoor upholstery.<br/><br/>Organized in coordinated groupings or trend stories, the fabric book shows how the fabrics might be used or paired together. The fabric book was specially engineered for tabletop display with the front cover folding out allowing the book to stand on its own like an easel. This concept was inspired by the large \u2018show horses\u2019 the Sunbrella design team uses to present new fabrics.<br/><br/>The fabric book\u2019s cover features blue magenta Arrestox\u00ae for a natural cloth feel, with magenta red text screen printed on top for a modern, makers feel. The design is intentionally understated, allowing the fabrics to speak for themselves.<br/><br/>In conjunction with the fabric book, the swatch card acts as a smaller sales tool ideal for portability. The card folds out, featuring small fabric swatches of solids and textures, and printed images of jacquard and stripe patterns that have larger repeats. The swatch card utilizes PLIKE\u00ae Papers, a unique stock material that embraces touch with an enticing texture. The choice of this material was also intentional, representative of Sunbrella\u2019s fiber whose color goes all the way to the core.",

After her apprenticeship with Marcel Breuer, her career and work ultimately took her New York City; working on hundreds of projects ranging from Bronx Community College, to Battery Park City, and the renewal of the St Regis Hotel in 1991. Celebrating her memory and designs: Sensitive, beautiful and always with a sense of purpose, NY2O, a family owned company, continue her design centric legacy with ongoing work to honor the precious resource that is water. <br/><br/>Her patented design of the bottle features an impressive groove running along the entire vertical length. The beauty is created with asymmetric dimensional planes. Form following function, beauty was indeed paramount to encourage reuse and sustainability for an everyday product. A sense of duty to the end-user to ensure recycling and find creative uses. This groove presented a design challenge for the label. <br/><br/>Taking inspiration for Esther\u2019s personal collection of colored pencil artwork she created for many decades, the label is a marriage with the design of the bottle. The groove, is an ergonomic masterpiece for a drinking vessel. It also wonderfully bends light. <br/><br/>The label needed to emphasize the bottle, all the while possess meaningful branding. With geometric lines and patterns, it evokes the architecture of New York and at the same time, through the lens of the groove, creates a fluid and always changing landscape that is playful to the eye. Angle and lines are transformed into a prism of imagination. <br/><br/>Two patterns have been designed so far. One consists of diagonal lines that bends to look like wave patterns. The second pattern is a grid, that bends into a shimmering effect of water as seen through crystalline oceans and waterways. <br/><br/>These patterns distortions are unique and purposefully studied. It invites future exploration of design and art, all the while having continuity in product branding. It lends itself to further subtle changes for specific markets and cultures around the globe.",

Following a rebranding, Studio TK\u2019s Social Spaces IQ-EQ Magalog was introduced in 2017, with two goals. First, the magalog needed to establish the brand\u2019s point of view on why social spaces are important for promoting the work culture. Second, Social Spaces had to also showcase the brand\u2019s portfolio of products and emphasize new introductions. It was this combination, one of perspective and product, serving as both thought leadership piece and sales tool, that became the motivation to create the Social Spaces IQ-EQ magalog. <br/><br/>The magalog is divided into two thoughtful sections \u2014 IQ and EQ. The logic \u2013 IQ \u2013 and the poetics \u2013 EQ \u2013 of product and space are what begins to outline Studio TK\u2019s design approach, which in turn became the opportunity to frame the larger brand narrative. This structure served not only as the basis for the magalog content, but also the physical construction of the entire magalog. Much like the ideas behind IQ, there was logic in how the narrative was paced out and how readers would experience it. By utilizing a mixture of uncoated color paper stocks, the magalog introduces ideas around craft and materiality that bring an EQ-inspired resonance to the entire reading experience. As a subtle nod to Studio TK\u2019s belief that no two workplace cultures are alike, varied color combinations in the opening pages, accompanied by a mixture of bold and thin faces of the brand typeface, create a natural hierarchy, affecting the narrative flow and cadence. While most of the layouts show consistency, each editorial piece takes on a life of its own, leaving room for expression to further carry out the story\u2019s message.<br/> <br/>The overall theme of Social Spaces was further developed by Studio TK\u2019s leadership, product development and sales teams to better understand how the market was reacting to each new product launch. Visually, the photographic assets show the breadth and versatility of each product line, as well as the spatial context for using each product, reinforcing the notion that Studio TK\u2019s portfolio is flexibly considered to serve the diverse needs of different work cultures.<br/><br/>Social Spaces signals a seriousness and maturity for the brand \u2014 a provocative, inherent confidence is recognized from the cover and throughout the pages that follow. With this magalog, Studio TK makes it clear that spaces and products do not make a workplace culture, but instead contribute to it. Addressing this first hand allowed the brand to put forward a differentiated vision for how the products can facilitate and encourage a thriving work culture, further reinforcing the underlying truth that Studio TK is driven by a bigger north star and seeks to understand the power and potency of the work culture in order to inform how it can design products and spaces that unlock a work culture\u2019s innate potential.",

The volume is an anthology of essays by noted design professionals, scholars and writers \u2013 each with his or her own angle of vision, but who hold in common the conviction that design does, indeed, matter. Authors were chosen specifically for their diverse backgrounds and perspectives in order to give readers a multi-faceted picture of the elements that influence how spaces make us feel. Human psychology and memory, as well as color and materiality are some of the lenses contributors used to convey their ideas. The book was published with a goal to advance awareness and understanding of the various roles design plays in the workplace and why the investment in design can benefit a company\u2019s culture, productivity and financial performance. <br/><br/>The True Measure of a Space expands upon the conversation currently taking place around workplace design, one proposing that human factors such as wellness and happiness are crucial elements of workplace design. The book is centered around the idea that how we apply elements of design to a space can change the way we feel. Design can create a more positive experience, one that nurtures creativity and productive collaboration. Featuring a discussion across the types of spaces encountered in the modern office over the course of a workday, The True Measure of a Space, proposes that feeling welcome, empowered, connected, calm and comfortable helps people do their best work.<br/><br/>Photography created for the book illustrates the proposition that materials and forms, colors and textures, influence our experience of a space by communicating ideas and evoking emotions. In 1997, Teknion debuted a new corporate identity and developed advertising and collateral featuring the \u201cRocket Man,\u201d who became an icon of the company\u2019s focus on the future of business. Since that time, Teknion has often used whimsical illustrations and sophisticated concept-driven photography to accompany and provide visual commentary on the text of books like \u201cCo-Create\u201d and \u201cHigher Learning.\u201d Teknion continued that tradition in the first of the Design Does Matter series, which relied on light hearted sketches to support the concepts. Photography, rather than hand drawings, illustrates concepts or specific feelings in The True Measure of a Space as the text references real environments and thus, required the rich sensory connection that photography provides. Each image has multiple layers of meaning, as well as a wit and charm that makes the subject matter accessible and appealing. These stylized images also carried over to Teknion\u2019s spectrum of marketing initiatives including showroom displays, advertising and website.",

            "description_html": "When Bentley designs a new collection, it\u2019s much more than the right combination of texture, color and material. It\u2019s an extension of the brand and what differentiates the California-based commercial carpet manufacturer. And it\u2019s not just physical product, either. It\u2019s a story that resonates through everything. (los)t angeles is case in point. From the pattern names to the NeoCon experience, it was never \u201cjust carpet.\u201d (los)t angeles is a vibe. The Bentley vibe. <br/><br/>Not long ago, Bentley returned to its roots, taking a wide-angle, big picture view of Los Angeles\u2019 (L.A.) influence on its people and products. With the launch of (los)t angeles, it contrived the next chapter of its L.A. narrative \u2013 inspired by the sprawling, open book city that somehow manages to be gritty and razor-sharp while living up to its laid-back, sun-drenched bohemian reputation.<br/><br/>The modular and broadloom collection\u2019s branding and marketing material played on this story of reinvention, going beneath the glitz and behind the urban decay to help others discover the extraordinary and unexpected things. <br/><br/>Officially available to the market in January 2017, (los)t angeles debuted at NeoCon 2016. Known for crafting unique showroom experiences, Bentley didn\u2019t simply display the two carpet styles (Underground and Trespass); it invited showgoers into a journey of juxtaposition. Conquest and sin; loss and growth; decay and renewal. As you moved along, the showroom\u2019s look and feel shifted from old and run-down to moderately built to a completely renewed structure \u2013 a reflection of L.A.\u2019s everchanging landscape. Mexican coffee, local California Lagunitas beer and branded flask water bottles (a designer favorite!) were added touches of Bentley\u2019s (los)t angeles flare. <br/><br/>Across the street at the company\u2019s secondary showroom, visitors discovered their own story with an aura reading/photography station. Multiple giveaways, including opportunities to receive inspirational Giving Keys necklaces \u2013 with proceeds supporting L.A.\u2019s homeless community \u2013 reinforced Bentley\u2019s (los)t angeles narrative. <br/><br/>The branding and marketing campaign continued into 2017 with eye-grabbing \u201clook books\u201d of inspiration photos shot by the product designer himself. The barren Salton Sea and the abandoned zoo, among other \u201cforgotten places,\u201d offered an eerily edgy yet oddly elegant view into the textures, colors and energy that inspired the collection. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, advertisements featured vibrant blue broadloom carpet draped in an industrial-looking factory, thinly veiled with smoke \u2013 a mix of old and new, forgotten and found elements. Exciting yet unexpected. The ads and collateral, PR, social media and event experiences were united by more than the one product they were designed to showcase. They were all unmistakably Bentley. <br/><br/>Every Bentley marketing and branding campaign, but perhaps especially that of (los)t angeles, serves to cement its story: the L.A. vibe, the collision of new and old, strange yet brilliant, lost but always found.",

We have the privilege to work with three high-profile individuals simultaneously, who have extremely demanding day jobs, and who were willing to be totally committed to a new design project.<br/><br/>The first time I met Terry Crews we discussed how important it is to support emerging designers and considered how we might partner in the future to help young talent. The more we spoke, I was impressed by his design knowledge and commitment to art and design.\u00a0 After doing more research on his background, I realized what a keen eye he has for scale and proportion and more importantly how skilled he is at painting and drawing. I went back to him a day later and said if we\u2019re going to do a project together he should channel his passion and be the designer himself \u2013 not just a benefactor to someone else. He accepted the proposition and very quickly produced an amazing body of sketches for our first concept meeting. We narrowed it down to three: the Ibis sofa series, a group of tables and benches named Float, and a truly unique seating and table piece titled Lily Pad.<br/><br/>Tift Merritt has never been one to accept the status quo. After receiving a best album Grammy nomination, she moved to Paris to write music with a completely different appeal. She has always been passionate about craft and textiles, ribbon and trim - collecting them from around the world when she is on tour. She started handcrafting bespoke guitar straps for her musician friends, incorporating her assortment of trimmings with leather.\u00a0 When she showed me some of her recent work, I realized she could design an interesting array of striped textiles based on inspiration from her collection. Fortunately, she agreed and began the design process of determining scale, repeat sizes, and textures. Within two weeks she presented us with over twenty pattern options. We ultimately edited the selection down to six designs in 53 colorways, ranging in scope from woven textural stripes to complimentary solids. Pattern names Cadence, Verse, Reverb, Swing, Forte and Solo are derived from a variety of musical influences.<br/><br/>Joe Gebbia is most commonly recognized as the co-founder of one of the most successful businesses of this century, Airbnb. Even fewer know he is an accomplished designer with degrees in graphic and industrial design from the Rhode Island School of Design. His concept was the essence of simplicity and purity, which is always the fundamental attribute of great design. He based his idea on two simple building blocks that could be used to create an entire community of flexible products. His two basic elements became the Neighborhood Collection, the most comprehensive and flexible line of furniture we have ever introduced. I appreciate the utility of the product and its unassuming form, but for me, the unique zig-zag stitching on each piece makes it incredibly special and elevates the entire offering.\u201d<br/><br/>Jerry Helling",

It\u2019s focused on simple, clean lines, and opaque finishes. With six bold colors and sleek shapes, Vermont Modern is perfect for urban spaces (or any space looking for a modern piece that pops). There\u2019s often a sense of movement, a kinetic element or something inherent to the design that demands attention. Every piece is made in Castleton, Vermont by artisans using environmentally responsible manufacturing techniques including non-VOC powder coats, a phosphate-free bioremediation cleaner for wash solutions and recycled and recyclable materials. Designers and makers, engineers and production, and the entire staff are all under one roof.<br/><br/>From brand exploration through development, to logos, fonts and color palette, Vermont Modern was entirely brought to life by our in-house Art Directors. All print ads, collateral materials and graphics were conceived and executed on-site. A new website was designed in-house, as well as the design and execution of a full digital ad campaign, and eMail marketing efforts. Social media campaigns were waged across Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Houzz, and Vimeo. Blogs, on vermontmodern.com, and guest-featured VM-blog pop-ups on other sites, helped to get the word out for this exciting, new brand.<br/><br/>And, who can resist a pink deer?",

Glen Raven Custom Fabrics is changing the way its line of Sunbrella\u00ae fabrics is displayed and sold with the new Elements fabric book and swatch card.<br/><br/>Elements is a curation of essential textiles. The 220 fabrics in this collection are the foundational pieces for design and are featured in the Elements fabric book on a three-year rotation. <br/><br/>Traditionally organized in coordinated groupings, the new fabric book showcases the foundational fabrics by color to make it easier for designers and consumers to quickly locate fabrics in their desired palette. Three stacks of large sample sizes feature solids, stripes and jacquards, and textures.<br/><br/>The fabric book was specially engineered for tabletop display with the front cover folding out allowing the book to stand on its own like an easel. This concept was inspired by the large \u2018show horses\u2019 the Sunbrella design team uses to present new fabrics.<br/><br/>The branding was inspired by the periodic table. Just as the elements in the periodic table are foundational to our existence, the fabrics in this collection act as foundational elements in design. The simple, clean typography plays with metallic and natural finishes and is screen printed on Arrestox\u00ae for a natural cloth feel. The design is intentionally understated, allowing the fabrics to speak for themselves.<br/><br/>The swatch card is a smaller sales tool ideal for portability. The card folds out, featuring small fabric swatches of solids and textures, and printed images of jacquard and stripe patterns that have larger repeats. The swatch card utilizes PLIKE\u00ae Papers, unique stock that embraces touch with an enticing texture. The choice of this material was also intentional, representative of Sunbrella\u2019s fiber whose color goes all the way to the core.",

This inspired the company to create Aqua Pella, a memorable video campaign that stands head and shoulders above other messages in today\u2019s chaotic media.<br/>Aqua Pella depicts the new single-lever faucets endowed with human voices and personalities in a The Voice-like singing audition. The headliners stepping up to the stage in the video include the clean-lined Arpeggio, the geometrically inspired Bel Canto, and the sleek Zen-like Morro Bay. <br/><br/>With a personality to match their distinctive design, each of the Pixar-character inspired faucets \u201ccomes to life,\u201d determined to achieve its goal of making the pages of the California Faucets product catalog. When the camera zooms in on Arpeggio, the cylindrical standout in Satin Nickel, and Morro Bay, an architecturally bold style in Oil Rubbed Bronze, both faucets contribute their Bass and Contralto voices to the harmony. Also playing a leading role is the Bel Canto, which in Polished Nickel sublimely uses its deep Baritone voice \u00e1 la Barry White.<br/><br/>Inspired by the success of the Pitch Perfect film series and popular musical TV comedies like Glee, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Noah Taft, a former writer and TV/film producer, focused on humor to captivate the audience. \u201cIt struck me: Why not let a group of animated faucets create the same type of a cappella magic?\u201d Taft says. \u201cThe video stands out among the typical marketing messages in our industry that are designed to sell first and entertain last.\u201d<br/><br/>Goals for the video included: increase product and brand awareness among California Faucets retailers, designers, architects, custom builders, and the consumer; have Aqua Pella \u201cgo viral\u201d via social media and within the typically conservative Kitchen &amp; Bath industry; make the leap from electronic media and in-showroom videos to television in all major U.S. markets. Aqua Pella accomplished all of this, and more. <br/><br/>The ad has run on multiple local TV markets, primarily on HGTV and the Food Channel, in select areas of New York, California, Arizona, Oregon, New Jersey, and others. It has also run in New England on NBC during a timeslot preceding The Today Show. Thanks to the Aqua Pella video, a record-breaking number of California Faucets resellers feature the new faucet collection in their showrooms. Plus, assisted by the company\u2019s Social Media and PR campaigns, the video has resulted in an overwhelming increase in \u201cword of mouth\u201d brand awareness for both California Faucets and its Single-Lever Bath Faucet designs. <br/><br/>In a market not typically known for using CGI animation and guerilla marketing tactics, producing the Aqua Pella video was a bold move. The remarkable results of the Aqua Pella video marketing campaign has proven that bringing a product to \u201clife\u201d by creating characters that inspire an emotional connection is an engaging, memorable, and fun way to promote an everyday commodity.<br/><br/>View the Aqua Pella video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiMal20GaUE",

Taking full advantage of the packaging freedom offered by electrification, the design and engineering teams took the opportunity to rethink the vehicle\u2019s overall proportions.<br/><br/>The result is an exceptional vehicle that combines an advanced cab-forward design inspired by the Jaguar C-X75 supercar \u2013 incorporating the smooth silhouette of a coupe, in a five-seat SUV. The I\u2011PACE Concept embodies the technological advances under its skin \u2013 and the Jaguar design team\u2019s belief that consumers are ready for bolder electric vehicle designs.<br/><br/>The electric drive system afforded the design team additional freedom to achieve the dynamic proportions on the I-PACE Concept. Leveraging the technological possibilities of electric driving, the I-PACE Concept introduces big design changes and finds fresh expression for the premium, personal touches and British craftsmanship Jaguar is known for.<br/><br/>Without an internal combustion engine and transmission tunnel to package, the design of the I-PACE Concept brings the cabin forward, extends the wheelbase and shortens the overhangs. This enables the silhouette to become more aerodynamic and the haunches to develop more powerful proportions. It also enlarges the interior space and improves vehicle dynamics and visibility.<br/><br/>As a result, the profile of the I-PACE Concept has more in common with the C-X75 mid-engine supercar than conventional SUVs. The evidence is clear in the cab-forward proportions, the dynamic heart line, curve of the front fenders, powerful proportions of the rear haunches and the large, purposeful wheels. Despite this, the overall footprint of the I-PACE Concept is as compact as a conventional mid-sized SUV. The long, 117.72 inch (2,990mm) wheelbase creates a voluminous interior with a level of rear knee room usually only found in full-size SUVs and luxury sedans.<br/><br/>The five-seat I-PACE Concept is a clear statement of plans for a production Jaguar model with future-focused design, pervading the open, spacious interior. It also showcases a blend of new technologies and traditional materials that characterize a vision for what a Jaguar electric luxury vehicle could be.<br/><br/>The I-PACE Concept is a perfect example of how much interior space the Jaguar cab-forward design and electric powertrain creates.<br/><br/>Jaguar cockpits have always been driver focused; the I-PACE Concept is no different. Inside, the cockpit is complemented by intuitive interface designs and advanced materials that reflect Jaguar craftsmanship in new and innovative ways.<br/><br/>The I-PACE Concept is very much a drivers\u2019 car but the interior has been painstakingly crafted to ensure that all occupants share the sense of being in something special \u2013 that\u2019s what being inside a Jaguar is all about. Luxurious, contemporary materials, perfectly executed surfaces and exquisite finishes are found throughout.<br/><br/>For most customers, the I-PACE Concept will be the first electric car they have owned. Research and innovations by the engineering and design teams have simplified the ownership experience and lowered the barriers to adoption. The electric motors, battery pack and management systems give the best possible performance and a useful range for most daily journeys.",

Over time, Cadillac\u2019s designers identify and fulfill needs in ways that cultivate an experience that elevates, enriches life and connects on an emotional level. At Cadillac, concept vehicles go beyond vision and a great canvas for showcasing the studio\u2019s forward-reaching thinking, passion and optimism.<br/> <br/>Escala \u2014 Spanish for \u201cscale\u201d\u2014 is a concept for a larger, more elite and expressive companion to the recently launched 2016 Cadillac CT6, the brand\u2019s new range-topping prestige sedan. Designed by the very same designers, sculptors, studio, and skilled craftspeople working on several upcoming production models, Escala offers a clear view of the future portfolio. Simplicity was paramount and with it, restraint.<br/> <br/>\u201cMy brief to the designers was to create a car you desperately want to drive, and one in which you want to be driven,\u201d said Andrew Smith, Cadillac global executive director of design. The central idea of two worlds coming together set the stage.<br/> <br/>Escala features a new and evolved face of Cadillac design that will begin appearing on future production models. This includes a new expression of Cadillac\u2019s vertical lighting, a brand signature since 1948. Thin, OLED lighting elements are set deep within the fascia, creating a sinister look, day and night. Other details inviting discovery include a three-dimensional precision pattern in the grille design and 22-inch wheels with two layers of spokes.<br/> <br/>Escala features a \u201cdual personality\u201d interior crafted with distinctly different zones: The front is focused on modern technology, while the rear delivers relaxation. An array of three, thin, curved OLED screens present the technology for the driver, their back sides wrapped in hand-stitched leather embossed with the Cadillac script.<br/>Escala\u2019s approach to connectivity and control are a prototype for the user experience in development for future Cadillac production models. The system features a central control module enabling tactile commands in addition to voice and gesture control technology. Cadillac\u2019s \u201cflying Goddess\u201d icon nestled in the jewel-like rotary controller is a subtle nod to the brand\u2019s rich heritage.<br/><br/>Transition is a major theme of Escala and the dual personality is also expressed in the pairing of dark and light colors and in material selection. In the interior, the interplay of leather and wood in the front evolves into luxurious fabric and metal in the rear. The wool-blend fabric and precise stitching evoke the feeling of a modern suit. Even the bespoke door d\u00e9cor celebrate the materials with each piece made by hand. It is worth noting everything proposed in the Escala\u2019s color and trim details is within the realm and reach of future production.<br/> <br/>The Escala Concept utilizes Cadillac\u2019s new RWD-centric large luxury car architecture, featuring one of the world\u2019s most advanced body structures, which debuted on the new CT6. The mixed-material construction enables unprecedented agility and efficiency. The new 4.2-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine is a prototype of a new system in development for future Cadillac model.",

            "description_html": "The Rolls-Royce VISION NEXT 100, codenamed 103EX, today made its North American debut at the historic Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California. 103EX is the marque\u2019s first ever pure \u2018Vision Vehicle\u2019 and defines the future of luxury mobility. It presents an intriguing and aesthetically dynamic vision of the future of luxury mobility \u2013 a completely personal, effortless and autonomous Rolls-Royce experience, wrapped in a design that ensures a \u2018Grand Sanctuary\u2019 for its occupants and a \u2018Grand Arrival\u2019. <br/><br/>103EX is one of four visionary creations announced by the BMW Group in Munich on 7 March 2016, as it launched its centenary celebrations. <br/><br/>In addition to being the centenary of the BMW Group, 2016 also represents a seminal moment in the history of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. For Rolls-Royce, the end of production of the seventh generation Phantom \u2013 considered by aficionados to be \"the best car in the world\" \u2013 represents the completion of the first phase of the Rolls-Royce brand\u2019s renaissance under BMW Group custodianship. The success of Phantom, Ghost, Wraith and now Dawn serves as the foundation for a bold new chapter. <br/><br/>103EX is the vision of the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars design team, led by Director of Design, Giles Taylor. In the spirit of the great coach-built cars of the past, Rolls Royce will create the chassis of the future, hand-built from the most advanced materials and powered by zero emissions powertrain. <br/><br/>The \u2018Voice of Eleanor\u2019 inhabits 103EX, delivering the dream of an effortless future to her owners. Digitally connected to every aspect of her owners\u2019 lives and her surrounding environment, \u2018Eleanor\u2019 becomes their virtual assistant and chauffeur, freeing them of all effort and encumbrance. Ever vigilant, \u2018Eleanor\u2019 safely delivers her passengers to their destination, having already predicted the situation and surroundings that await them.<br/><br/>As one would expect from a Rolls-Royce, the environment of the Grand Sanctuary is crafted from the most precious and contemporary of materials. What is unexpected is the feeling of lightness and simplicity, an effortless elegance. The centrepiece of the cabin is the beautiful sofa. The best seat in the house, it is an exquisite, futuristic interpretation of modern furniture design. Clothed in the most opulent fabrics, it gives the impression of floating within the cocoon of the cabin thanks to the artful use of lighting and modern materials. <br/>The Grand Arrival<br/><br/>The very size of 103EX announces the importance of its precious cargo. At 5.9 metres long and 1.6 metres high, it mirrors the perfect dimensions of today\u2019s Phantom Extended Wheelbase, whilst the ever constant Spirit of Ecstasy grows in stature, harking back to the regal Phantoms of the 1920s. <br/><br/>\u201cThe Grand Arrival gesture of the Rolls-Royce VISION NEXT 100 creates a stage for our important passengers as they arrive at their ultimate destination,\u201d comments Taylor. \u201cIt is an expression of our intrinsic understanding of the possibilities for a true luxury brand and the desires of its customers.\u201d",

            "description_html": "Cadillac Design is about looking forward. All the great Cadillacs of the past \u2013 while possessing the DNA of the vehicles before them \u2013 were provocative yet timeless. As a studio team, Cadillac designers are evolving the brand signature in a design approach that is progressive, not prescriptive. Concept cars are a great catalyst for this. <br/> <br/>The phrase \u201csimple is hard\u201d carries special relevance within the Cadillac studios and, with the introduction of the Escala concept car, it offers insights about the future of interior design from this distinctly American brand. The Cadillac Escala concept interior is about space, simplicity and sophistication.<br/> <br/>Escala \u2014 Spanish for \u201cscale\u201d\u2014 is a concept for a larger, more elite and expressive companion to the recently launched 2016 Cadillac CT6 and created by the designers, sculptors, studio, and skilled craftspeople working on upcoming production vehicles. <br/> <br/>Inspired by many of the vintage Cadillacs with a driver\u2019s cockpit in the front and a separate passenger lounge in the rear, Escala\u2019s creative brief was \u201cdesign a chauffeured-driven vehicle that you would also passionately want to drive yourself.\u201d Hence, the notion of transition was a major theme for the designers. In this car, the front is about technology and performance, and the rear is about relaxation. <br/> <br/>A prominent feature in front is an array of curved OLED screens. Rethinking the traditional automotive cluster and center stack, the screens are wrapped in hand-stitched leather and presented to the driver atop a sculptural wave of genuine American walnut. The curvature, configuration and layering is deliberate and overt to offer a hierarchy of information that enhances the driving experience. In the rear, the technology is on demand or covert, in keeping with its \u2018being driven\u2019 environment.<br/> <br/>The Escala\u2019s warm, light interior color represents a bold departure and highlights future interior design in terms of form e.g. economy of line work, sculptural surfaces and jewelry embellishment and the \u2018less is more\u2019 approach. Cadillac is very much about the innovative use of authentic materials in unexpected ways to delight the senses and elevate the experience. Fabric, inspired by design partners in the fashion world, replaces traditional leather in many areas. Cut, wrapped and sewn by the in-house tailor using a special titanium needle, designers used it for the same reason that it is a great material for a suit - textural, tailored and luxurious.<br/> <br/>The dual-personality interior is also highlighted by unique door d\u00e9cor \u2013 beginning as aluminum in the front then precisely transitioning to wood in the rear. It is a distinctive piece of hand craftsmanship, built in the shops in Michigan. <br/> <br/>Subtle, second-read elements include cut-and-sew and details like the embossed Cadillac script on the Escala\u2019s leather-wrapped OLED screen and Cadillac goddess on the rotary controller. Moreover, everything proposed in the Escala\u2019s color and trim details is within the realm and reach of future Cadillac production models. Every detail was considered. In the rear, Escala\u2019s load floor is choreographed to rise automatically and present the cargo area when the liftback is opened.",

It must be roomy and comfortable for all passengers, with plenty of space to store both large and small items. <br/><br/>Customers in this segment want the utility of a truck with the beautiful design of a car. The interior design team used long, horizontal, solid truck-like forms as the foundation for the interior theme, but then softened those forms and wrapped them in premium materials and accented with d\u00e9cor and jewelry-like details.<br/><br/>The touch-screen center display and controls are oriented vertically to make them easy to see and use. Infotainment and climate controls are grouped separately in ergonomic, easy-to-find locations. The display was carefully placed to make sure it was within a comfortable reach and to eliminate unwanted glare. One of the most popular features available to our customers is the storage compartment hidden behind the touch-screen display.<br/><br/>The 2018 Chevy Traverse features an enhanced Smart Slide seat that lets customers tilt and slide the second-row passenger-side seat forward for easy access to the third row, even when a child car seat is mounted in place.<br/><br/>Another unique storage area is the subfloor compartment located beneath the rear cargo floor, which offers about 3.2 cu. ft. of additional space. When customers need to transport larger items, they can fold down the second- and third-row seats to create a flat load floor with the largest cargo area in this class.<br/><br/>The upholstery demonstrates great attention to detail, with precise stitching at the seams, and the durability that customers need and expect. Premium materials are in areas customers are most likely to see and come in contact with. The more durable materials are located down low, where shoes and cargo materials are likely to rub against them.<br/><br/>The large d\u00e9cor accents throughout the interior are finished with Galvano chrome, which has a soft satin appearance, while the smaller details and controls are accented with bright chrome. Piano Black is used throughout all trims on the infotainment center, outer vents, and cluster hood. The result is a very clean and modern appearance.<br/><br/>Traverse is a family vehicle, so most customers will have kids sliding in and out of the vehicle on a regular basis. Soil-repellant Premium Cloth and high-wear bolsters offer customers the durability they need. Premier and High Country trim levels offer a more premium look with perforated leather-appointed seating. <br/><br/>With Jet Black anticipated to be a volume-selling color, designers focused on making it as expressive as possible. On models equipped with Jet Black Cloth seats, added an embellished insert with a unique heathered appearance that not only looks softer and more inviting but also helps hide dirt and debris. This new styling element was applied to the other two fabric colors as well.",

            "description_html": "The interior of the Bugatti Chiron reflects the stylistic themes of the exterior including the central fin inspired by the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic. This approach ensures a symmetrical layout in the interior. <br/><br/>The duo-tone colour scheme is a classic element in Bugatti\u2019s design DNA and finds its strong impression in the Chiron\u2019s interior. At the same time, the design theme of the Bugatti line is expressed most strongly in the interior of the vehicle. For example, the C-shaped line, called the \u201cBugatti signature line\u201d, which is already a dominant element in the exterior side view of the super sports car, is also taken up in the passenger compartment as a separating line between the symmetrical units for the driver and passenger. The C-shaped light strip emerges from the front bonnet into the passenger compartment as a raised graphic element and merges seamlessly into the dashboard. From here, it flows over the armrest between the seats to the back wall where it rises to the roof liner; at the front, it ends at the rear-view mirror. The homogeneously lit, dimmable light bar is the longest light conductor used in automobiles. This is not the only superlative as it has a surround that is machined from a single piece of aluminium in a complex process. <br/><br/>The cockpit layout of the Bugatti Chiron consistently follows functional requirements. In order to keep the central console as slim as possible and to allow a spacious impression, the climate control and infotainment systems have been separated. Bugatti pilots have all the driving dynamics information they need within their field of vision. The instruments visible through the steering wheel with its central horseshoe emblem include the analogue speedometer, the two supplementary digital displays, with the mechanical speed indicator standing out as a result of its exclusive quality. The speedometer runs up to the magic figure of 300 mph and is a feast for the eyes with the exclusive appearance of a precious Swiss watch. <br/><br/>The steering wheel is a classic example of the perfect combination of form and function. With an entirely new design, the steering wheel is the pilot\u2019s control centre. There is no need to take a hand off the steering wheel in order to operate any essential systems. Two multifunction buttons installed on the left and right sides of the inner rim allow the driver to control all the multimedia features of the car, including navigation, telephone, sound system and many other functions. Below the multi-function button, there is a rotary switch for selecting various driving modes on the left-hand side and the starter button on the right-hand side. At the bottom of the wheel, the driver finds a button to activate the launch control function. Bugatti continues to practise its philosophy of \u201cWhat you see is what you get\u201c consistently with the Chiron. This vehicle is constructed in every respect from authentic materials. Parts that look like carbon fibre, aluminium or leather are really made from these materials.",

So when the marquee designed the first new Phantom in more than a decade, it knew it had to produce a vehicle unmatched in style, status and sophistication. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars knew that to sustain its moniker as the \u201cpinnacle of automotive luxury,\u201d it could not merely update the Phantom\u2019s aesthetic appearance, but needed to reimagine luxury travel as a category. <br/><br/>One of the main updates in the new Phantom was the vehicle frame, coined the \u201cArchitect of Luxury.\u201d The all-new aluminum underpinning added lightweight features while still providing the stability and grace to maintain Rolls-Royce\u2019s \u201cmagic carpet\u201d smooth riding experience. <br/><br/>In addition to an all-new architectural design, the vehicle doors were automated with a press of a button located on the handle, which allows for an assistant or valet to effortlessly embrace the rider within the vehicle. <br/><br/>In addition, a central nervous system connects and controls all the various advanced intelligence systems of the Phantom, making it the most advanced luxury motor car available on the market. Some, but not all, assistance systems on-board New Phantom include: Alertness Assistant, a 4-camera system with Panoramic View, all-round visibility including helicopter view, Night Vision and Vision Assist, Active Cruise Control, collision warning, pedestrian warning, cross-traffic warning, lane departure and lane change warning, an industry leading 7x3 high-resolution head-up display, WiFi hotspot, and of course the latest navigation and entertainment systems.<br/><br/>The advancement of the new Phantom doesn\u2019t end with the architecture or exterior, but is further amplified with updated features on the interior. It is the most silent motor car in the world. Extensive research and development ensured this, including 6mm two-layer glazing all around the car, more than 130kg of sound insulation, the largest ever cast aluminum joints in a body-in-white for better sound insulation, and use of high absorption materials. It is a perfect 360\u00b0 cocooning effect in a motor car that is approximately 10 per cent quieter than its predecessor at 100km/h.<br/><br/>Additionally, for the first time, the motor car\u2019s dashboard was redesigned, allowing patrons to commission artwork that spans the width of \u2018The Gallery\u2019 in their new Phantom. Rolls-Royce worked with several acclaimed artists, spanning from porcelain artists to gold welders, to develop galleries for future Phantom owners to select from, creating another element of luxury unknown in today\u2019s vehicles. The artwork within \u2018The Gallery\u2019 are enclosed in a continuous case of toughened glass that runs the full width of the dash area. The instrument digital dials are framed with chrome, adding a degree of jewelry and continuity throughout the front of the interior.<br/><br/>All in all, the new Rolls-Royce Phantom offers customers with the most distinguished taste the pinnacle of luxury. From the re-imagined exterior, to the most minute interior detail, were careful designed to offer the most luxurious vehicle ever created.",

The Velar is defined by a visually reductive approach in its design, which evolves the Range Rover DNA and previews the next generation of Range Rover vehicles.<br/><br/>Visually, the Velar is beautifully balanced with powerful proportions; a continuous waist line rises through to the taut tapered lines of the rear and a generous 113.15-inch wheelbase contributes significantly to both its elegant design and spacious interior. <br/><br/>The interior of the Velar reaffirms ideals of elegant simplicity, sophistication and refinement. An unwavering belief in reductionism has been fully employed, with switches being kept to an absolute minimum to help create a calm streamlined sanctuary.<br/><br/>In order to achieve this elegant simplicity, inside, designers relied on a new InControl Touch Pro Duo infotainment system; the centerpiece of the vehicle\u201fs interior. Touch Pro Duo features two 10-inch high-definition touchscreens integrated seamlessly behind hidden-until-lit surfaces. These slim, intuitive displays work in harmony with the cabin architecture while adding an overall sense of modernity congruent with the vehicle\u2019s reductive exterior design approach.

It rakes back dramatically towards the windshield underlining the vehicle\u2019s dynamic driving characteristics. The slender air vents reinforce its reductive, technology-enabled design approach.<br/><br/>Offering greater choice to customers, an innovative new Premium Textile seat material is offered as an alternative to leather upholstery. Developed with Kvadrat, Europe\u2019s leading manufacturer of high-quality design textiles, this sustainable material comes in Dapple Grey and features wool-blend textile contrasted with a Suedecloth insert available in Light Oyster or Ebony. The Suedecloth fibers are created from recycled plastic bottles and crafted into a textured non-woven material that\u2019s soft to the touch.<br/><br/>Perfectly-crafted trim finishers celebrate the natural look and texture of authentic materials. Choices include a Satin Blonde Linear veneer, which is pale-stained and has a satin feel open-pore finish to give a very modern, airy character, and the Argento Pin-stripe veneer, which is distinguished by its high-gloss finish and silver streaks to emphasize the wood grain. Another highlight is Carbon Fiber Copper weave trim, created by weaving carbon fiber and copper filaments together under a high gloss finish. <br/><br/>Ambient LED lighting casts a soft glow over the interior, subtly highlighting the strong architectural lines and authentic materials for a calming atmosphere. Configurable ambient lighting technology offers a choice of 10 different color options.",

            "description_html": "The Chiron is the most modern interpretation of Bugatti\u2019s brand DNA. It embodies the new design language of the luxury brand. The accentuated lines of the Chiron were inspired by the legendary Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic, the most famous creation of Jean Bugatti, design genius and son of the founder Ettore. Achim Anscheidt, Director of Design at Bugatti, describes his task as follows: \u201cIn view of our extraordinary brand and the task in hand, it would not be adequate to simply draw a few fashionable lines. In terms of design, the Chiron was an opportunity to develop most of the basic elements required for an unambiguous stylistic concept from the extreme technical requirements of the vehicle with a view to underlining the performance of this unique super sports car.\u201d The lines of the new car show that the balance between \u201cbeauty\u201d and \u201cbeast\u201d needed in a modern Bugatti has been significantly shifted in the direction of aggression. This can be seen from the considerably more dynamic side line, the central fin that gives an impression of acceleration, the elongated rear wings and the more dynamic angle of attack. The most distinctive design features of the Chiron are the Bugatti horseshoe with the eighteyed front end, the C-bar on the side, also known as the \u201cBugatti signature line\u201d, the central fin as a reminiscence of the central seam on the Bugatti Atlantic, which extends over the entire vehicle to the rear, and the redesigned rear end with the newly developed rear light, which is unique in the automobile industry and gives the Chiron its distinctive Bugatti signature. Most of these elements have a technical background and have been designed to fully accentuate the growing performance requirements of the Chiron. Apart from the lamp housings, the front end with the eight-eye face features a highly effective air inlet for the cooling of the front wheels and brakes and therefore performs an important aerodynamic function. That also applies to the Bugatti signature line. It impressively reflects Bugatti\u2019s design ethos which ideally calls for shapes and lines to be derived from technical requirements. Its positioning was defined by the need to improve engine ventilation and ventilation performance in general at this point. The rear with its all-round trailing edge is the clearest example of form following performance in the design of the Chiron. It is shaped to ensure lower drag and to meet the requirements posed by the high power output, the new top speed and heat dissipation from the rear end. The suction effect behind the rear end allows the extraction of hot air collecting in the engine compartment. \u201cThis principle of form following performance defines the Chiron as an authentic technical product and a fascinating automobile sculpture,\u201d Anscheidt adds. \u201cBoth for our customers and for us as designers, it is important for a Bugatti to have a certain stylistic longevity so that it is still perceived as precious in 10 or even 50 years.\u201d",

The Velar is defined by a visually reductive approach in its design, which evolves the Range Rover DNA and previews the next generation of Range Rover vehicles.<br/><br/>Visually, the Velar is beautifully balanced with powerful proportions; a continuous waist line rises through to the taut tapered lines of the rear and a generous 113.15-inch wheelbase contributes significantly to both its elegant design and spacious interior. <br/><br/>Large alloy wheels \u2013 in particular the range of 22-inch designs \u2013 optimize the vehicle\u2019s stunning silhouette, while further enhancing the dramatic presence of the vehicle.<br/><br/>Advanced technology is pivotal to the contemporary design: the full-LED headlights are the most slender ever to appear on a production Land Rover vehicle. The flush deployable door handles on the Range Rover Velar help emphasize a taut, elegant design language and contribute to a coefficient of drag of only 0.32Cd making it the most aerodynamically efficient Land Rover vehicle to date.<br/><br/>The interior of the Velar reaffirms ideals of elegant simplicity, sophistication and refinement. An unwavering belief in reductionism has been fully employed, with switches being kept to an absolute minimum to help create a calm streamlined sanctuary.<br/><br/>In order to achieve this elegant simplicity, inside, designers relied on a new InControl Touch Pro Duo infotainment system; the centerpiece of the vehicle\u201fs interior. Touch Pro Duo features two 10-inch high-definition touchscreens integrated seamlessly behind hidden-until-lit surfaces. These slim, intuitive displays work in harmony with the cabin architecture while adding an overall sense of modernity congruent with the vehicle\u2019s reductive exterior design approach. All of this is equaled by the vehicle\u2019s practicality: luggage compartment volume is 34.4 cu. ft. behind row two.<br/><br/>Offering greater choice to customers, a sustainable, premium textile seat material is available as an alternative to leather. The Dapple Grey material was developed together with Kvadrat, Europe\u2019s leading manufacturer of high-quality design textiles, and is complemented with Suedecloth inserts in Ebony or Light Oyster. The Suedecloth fibers are created from recycled plastic bottles and crafted into a textured non-woven material that\u2019s soft to the touch.<br/><br/>The Range Rover Velar and Velar R-Dynamic range comprises of four selectively available specifications including Standard, S, SE or HSE, with three powertrain options depending on trim. Customers can also specify Black and Premium Exterior Packs for an even more distinguished appearance.",

            "description_html": "Designed, engineered and handcrafted in Britain, the new third-generation Bentley Continental GT combines spirited, focused performance with handcrafted luxury and cutting-edge technology, to create the finest Grand Tourer ever produced. The exterior design is based on a bold new vision that is unmistakably Bentley. The all-new body and materials save more than 80 kg over the previous Continental W12 body. To allow for such a bold reimagining, the aluminium skin has been crafted using Super Formed technology \u2013 a precision technique working with aluminium heated to 500\u00b0C which has previously been used on Bentley fenders. This method allows designers to invoke more complex, sharply defined body lines and a deeper, sculpted haunch muscle. The Continental GT is the first production car ever to have an entire body side made from the Super Formed process. The lighting on the Continental GT uses the latest LED Matrix technology, but it is the design of the head lamps that truly sets them apart. Inspired by the finest cut-crystal glasses, the internal surfaces are transparent with sharply defined edges that catch the light like a diamond. The interior of the new Continental GT showcases Bentley\u2019s unrivalled expertise in the authentic use of materials, from the highest-quality natural leathers, to rare, sustainably sourced veneers \u2013 including Koa, Bentley\u2019s newest veneer \u2013 and hand-polished chrome details. For the first time, unique dual-veneer options are offered. Over 10 square metres of wood are used in each Continental GT, and it takes nine hours to create and fit the wooden inlays by hand. Another hidden delight is the addition of bronze inserts between surfaces on the primary controls, which adds a level of fine detailing never seen before. The 20-way adjustable seats in the new Continental GT set new industry standards in comfort and refinement. A new, unique quilt is also available: called a \u2018diamond in diamond\u2019 quilt, the effect is of a floating quilted surface in a sea of leather, which is extraordinarily soft to touch. The new interior pattern features both stitching and embroidery. The inner diamonds are embroidered, using a specially-designed machine that balances high speed with quality. Eighteen months were spent developing the embroidery, individually optimising and programming the exact alignment of each one of the 712 stitches that make up each diamond shape \u2013 an unrivalled attention to detail. A Naim system is built into the front seats and eight sound modes is offered for the true audiophile. Laminated acoustic glass is used for the windscreen and side windows, resulting in a nine-decibel reduction in exterior noise ingress versus the outgoing model. The driver-orientated instrument panel is now fully digital and configurable by the driver. While the main dials appear to be real, they are in fact digital graphics designed to look three-dimensional. The innovative and industry-first Bentley Rotating Display first shows no screen in the centre of the dashboard, instead, the veneer flows uninterrupted across the dashboard, while a thin chrome bezel behind the steering wheel surrounds a digital instrument display.",

So when the marquee designed the first new Phantom in more than a decade, it knew it had to produce a vehicle unmatched in style, status and sophistication. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars knew that to sustain its moniker as the \u201cpinnacle of automotive luxury,\u201d it could not merely update the Phantom\u2019s aesthetic appearance, but needed to reimagine luxury travel as a category. <br/><br/>One of the main updates in the new Phantom was the vehicle frame, coined the \u201cArchitect of Luxury.\u201d The all-new aluminum underpinning added lightweight features while still providing the stability and grace to maintain Rolls-Royce\u2019s \u201cmagic carpet\u201d smooth riding experience. <br/><br/>In addition to an all-new architectural design, the vehicle doors were automated with a press of a button located on the handle, which allows for an assistant or valet to effortlessly embrace the rider within the vehicle. <br/><br/>In addition, a central nervous system connects and controls all the various advanced intelligence systems of the Phantom, making it the most advanced luxury motor car available on the market. Some, but not all, assistance systems on-board New Phantom include: Alertness Assistant, a 4-camera system with Panoramic View, all-round visibility including helicopter view, Night Vision and Vision Assist, Active Cruise Control, collision warning, pedestrian warning, cross-traffic warning, lane departure and lane change warning, an industry leading 7x3 high-resolution head-up display, WiFi hotspot, and of course the latest navigation and entertainment systems.<br/><br/>The advancement of the new Phantom doesn\u2019t end with the architecture or exterior, but is further amplified with updated features on the interior. It is the most silent motor car in the world. Extensive research and development ensured this, including 6mm two-layer glazing all around the car, more than 130kg of sound insulation, the largest ever cast aluminum joints in a body-in-white for better sound insulation, and use of high absorption materials. It is a perfect 360\u00b0 cocooning effect in a motor car that is approximately 10 per cent quieter than its predecessor at 100km/h.<br/><br/>Additionally, for the first time, the motor car\u2019s dashboard was redesigned, allowing patrons to commission artwork that spans the width of \u2018The Gallery\u2019 in their new Phantom. Rolls-Royce worked with several acclaimed artists, spanning from porcelain artists to gold welders, to develop galleries for future Phantom owners to select from, creating another element of luxury unknown in today\u2019s vehicles. The artwork within \u2018The Gallery\u2019 are enclosed in a continuous case of toughened glass that runs the full width of the dash area. The instrument digital dials are framed with chrome, adding a degree of jewelry and continuity throughout the front of the interior.<br/><br/>All in all, the new Rolls-Royce Phantom offers customers with the most distinguished taste the pinnacle of luxury. From the re-imagined exterior, to the most minute interior detail, were careful designed to offer the most luxurious vehicle ever created.",

After her apprenticeship with Marcel Breuer, her career and work ultimately took her New York City; working on hundreds of projects ranging from Bronx Community College, to Battery Park City, and the renewal of the St Regis Hotel in 1991. Celebrating her memory and designs: Sensitive, beautiful and always with a sense of purpose, NY2O, a family owned company, continue her design centric legacy with ongoing work to honor the precious resource that is water. <br/><br/>Her patented design of the bottle features an impressive groove running along the entire vertical length. The beauty is created with asymmetric dimensional planes. Form following function, beauty was indeed paramount to encourage reuse and sustainability for an everyday product. A sense of duty to the end-user to ensure recycling and find creative uses. This groove presented a design challenge for the label. <br/><br/>Taking inspiration for Esther\u2019s personal collection of colored pencil artwork she created for many decades, the label is a marriage with the design of the bottle. The groove, is an ergonomic masterpiece for a drinking vessel. It also wonderfully bends light. <br/><br/>The label needed to emphasize the bottle, all the while possess meaningful branding. With geometric lines and patterns, it evokes the architecture of New York and at the same time, through the lens of the groove, creates a fluid and always changing landscape that is playful to the eye. Angle and lines are transformed into a prism of imagination. <br/><br/>Two patterns have been designed so far. One consists of diagonal lines that bends to look like wave patterns. The second pattern is a grid, that bends into a shimmering effect of water as seen through crystalline oceans and waterways. <br/><br/>These patterns distortions are unique and purposefully studied. It invites future exploration of design and art, all the while having continuity in product branding. It lends itself to further subtle changes for specific markets and cultures around the globe.",

As distinctive as a work of modern architecture, the new design amplifies the blend inside \u2013 unchanged since 1870 \u2013 while placing Hennessy X.O on a modern aesthetic frontier. Hennessy X.O is the original \u201cExtra Old\u201d Cognac, created by Maurice Hennessy in 1870. <br/><br/>Hennessy X.O Limited Edition by Marc Newson is a modern take on a classic bottle and a timeless blend.<br/>Internationally renowned designer Marc Newson has reinterpreted the classic Hennessy X.O bottle, with the elegant simplicity that forms his signature style. The result is a modern twist on the iconic shape, a sleek design that embodies the essence of the original X.O Cognac. His challenge: how can a bottle tell the story of taste and awaken the senses? His answer: a design that makes us experience the blend, even before pouring a drop. A subtle series of curved lines catch the light, revealing infinite warm shades, hinting at the odyssey of flavors that awaits within.<br/><br/>Newson\u2019s limited edition design gives the signature Hennessy X.O bottle a wholly unexpected twist. Once he had pared the bottle\u2019s shape to its purest form, the designer chose to reprise its traditional decorative motifs \u2013 grapes and leaves \u2013 in a corrugated relief. These striations are perhaps the most daring design elements ever incorporated on the iconic Hennessy X.O bottle. <br/><br/>To reinforce the modern spirit of the new Hennessy X.O bottle, Newson and Hennessy reached beyond the usual confines of spirit bottle design to create a modern gift box presentation. To dramatize the fusion between the blend and the glass, Newson designed a clear transparent gift box, requiring cutting-edge manufacturing. The outer packaging design perfectly conveys Hennessy X.O\u2019s forward-looking spirit. The clear, ergonomic shape is molded in a complex plastic more typically used for perfume bottles.<br/><br/>The limited edition design perfectly complements the Hennessy X.O multi-faceted, sensorial taste experience. Simultaneously both elegant and complex, the original X.O Cognac is aged and blended to be bold, rich and persistent.",

It's a place where people meet to share their travel adventures, show each other their finds, and prepare for their next trip. It's about having time to drink, eat and talk, talk about the new flavors of other cultures and distant travels. <br/><br/>Echoing the ethos of the brand, HAVN is inspired by old shipping routes and harbor towns, and the ancient ships that transported spices and valuable materials such as gold, silver, copper and black coal. These ancient treasures from the ship belly inform both the exterior packaging design, as well as the product itself. Each bottle reflects one of the four ores. Inside, you'll taste a delicious blend of traditional spices used to flavor the gin. <br/><br/>HAVN offers four distinct products, each with its own character and flavor, representative of the in the four corners of the world -- which is also reflected in its packaging. Gins that, through their flavors, take you to different places, different customs, rituals and people. <br/><br/>Sas Adriaenssens is behind the product packaging and was also the chef and chief mixologist behind creating the HAVN's flavors. The glass bottles are hand-sprayed by hand, then finished with a proprietary technique to achieve a frosted effect. Each bottle is different and unique, communicate quality and high value with a distinguished design. <br/><br/>Sas came up with the design to clearly differentiate between different flavors within the product line, and to create definite visibility on the shelf. HAVN strategically launched with four flavors to ensure a wide position on the shelves of its retailers, with a sophisticated, minimal look.",

            "description_html": "The CALA teaware collection awakens the senses and elevates the experience of steeping, serving, and drinking tea. The collection is comprised of a modern porcelain teapot, Asian inspired teacups in two sizes, and a striking Western-style teacup and saucer. Each piece is designed with technical precision to enhance the tea steeping and tasting experience at a visceral level. The name of the collection, CALA, is inspired by the Calla Lily which, when in bloom, resembles the gracefully flared profiles of the pieces. <br/><br/>The CALA teapot is engineered to steep and serve the perfect pot of tea. The handle is subtly sloped downward to provide optimal balance as the tea is poured, requiring only a slight rotation of the wrist. The asymmetrical hip and wide body allow for uniform steeping. The spout is angled to pour tea from the middle of the pot delivering the most evenly extracted tea in every cup.<br/><br/>Inspired by traditional Chinese Gaiwan cups, the CALA tasting cups are ideal vessels for tasting delicate teas. The delicately flared lip distributes the beverage broadly over the palate for an enhanced tasting experience. The wide mouth allows the surface of the beverage to cool quickly for optimal tasting, and allows the aroma to float across the surface of the beverage to the lips as one sips. The handless profile of the cup is elegant and intuitive. When the vessel is comfortable to touch, the beverage is ready to drink. There is no need for a handle as the cup balances easily between thumb and index finger. <br/><br/>The CALA teacup adapts these technical principles in a modern interpretation of the traditional English teacup. CALA was designed for a fuller and more nuanced tasting experience. CALA is dishwasher and microwave safe and durable enough for home and commercial use.",

Different consistencies of concrete with different amount of pigments are prepared prior to the pouring. <br/>First the concrete with the most amount of pigment is poured, then gradually the concrete with less pigment and different liquidity is poured in. The concrete with no pigment is the last pour. The release agent is randomly applied to the bottom surface of the mold in order to provide conditions in which the pigmented concrete react to the agent in an unexpected manner. When the concrete is cured and taken off from the mold, the surface is treated with sealer.<br/>The location and the direction of sequential pour of the liquid state of concrete determine the final outcome of the pattern on the surface. <br/>The concrete disks are in different sizes from 35cm to 50cm in diameters, and about 7mm thick. Swivel mechanism is attached in the back, which lifts the disk off from the wall and enables the disk to be rotated to the desired orientation as well as periodical changes of appearance in space.<br/>LIQUID draws our attention to the surface pattern as optical texture as we look closely at the reflection on the mirror, giving a unique visual presence in space. This texture is in fact a visualization of natural phenomena of liquid movement captured in a brief moment (while also evoking the image of the moon in the night sky with moving clouds.)",

The architect\u2019s previous work as a goldsmith, jeweller and metal artist, combined with a rigorous architectural training, fuels the studio\u2019s continued interest in designing and detailing at all scales. <br/><br/>As part of the practice, the studio is developing a line of smaller household products called OBJEX. These products are informed by the studio\u2019s design philosophy as it applies to larger, architectural design solutions and details. At this time, the OBJEX line include vases, candle holders, coasters and various tabletop objects that are currently in development.<br/><br/>The preferred minimal material palette of the products includes exotic woods and patinaed metals; these materials echo those often used in the numerous architectural projects designed by the studio. This homogeneous approach to design ensures that the architecture and interiors are one. The jewellery-like detailing of the OBJEX collection reinforces the studio\u2019s philosophy as it echoes the larger, architectural projects.<br/><br/>PUX, one product from the OBJEX collection, is a double-sided candle holder. It functions as a tapered candle holder on one side and a tea-light candle holder on the reverse side. The puck-like forms are currently fabricated from solid walnut and ash and solid oxidized bronze. The blackened bronze trim throughout creates a cohesive grouping. <br/><br/>Small and simple in form, the PUX blend easily into any modern or traditional interior space. They are 4\u201d in diameter and 1.5\u201d high. Although diminutive in size, their minimal design and hefty weight allow them to stand alone as a strong sculptural object in any context.<br/><br/>The positive response for PUX from both the design industry and the general public has been overwhelming. Our initial market research indicates that there is definite sales potential for the products in both the residential and commercial markets. Private residential clients in the office are interested in purchasing several PUX, as they work well with the materials and aesthetics of their homes. Restaurants and hotels are interested in purchasing the product for their dining tables and bars and design colleagues are interested in purchasing PUX for their own commercial and residential Clients. In addition, various shops specializing in furniture and housewares are interested in showcasing the PUX line, to be sold in their stores at the retail level.<br/><br/>The positive response from both the design industry and the public focused on the simplicity of the design. It was also important for people to hold the PUX in their hands, to experience the substantial weight of the solid wood and metal forms. The jewellery-like detailing of the PUX, and of the OBJEX product line overall, has proven to have great appeal to the public.<br/><br/>Presently, the studio is working with a local fabricator to develop the line further. Together, they are investigating several other material options, including various wood species, natural stones, metals, and Corian, for production purposes. This could allow for exclusivity for the many interested purchasers across the design disciplines.",

As architects, we designed the Lustra Collection of keepsake boxes and candle holders, each in three sizes and three colors, to create a unique and dramatic interplay of form, material and the seductive sparkle of crystal. We embraced this opportunity to craft sophisticated objects for everyday use at an accessible price point and bring joy to their users because every detail of their expression is so thoroughly and carefully considered.<br/><br/>The Lustra Collection brings our architectural sensibility of beauty, innovation, and visual complexity to the design of tabletop objects. By experimenting with dimension on a smaller scale, we create a luminous dialogue of geometry and form. Each piece is a micro work of architecture, a highly sculptural and crafted exploration. At the core of this design, we celebrate the way crystal refracts light through the geometry of each sinuously curved keepsake box lid and faceted candle holder base. The entire collection is carefully designed to accentuate crystal\u2019s innately seductive optical properties.<br/><br/>We designed keepsake boxes in three sizes, priced from $300 to $600, animating a curvilinear lid of sculptural faceted solid Swarovski crystal against the rectilinear geometry of a cube-like base -- in lustrous bronze, copper or pewter. As both base and lid capture the refraction of light, this play of geometries and materials is subtle and luxurious, as well as striking and dramatic. Grouped together in multiple combinations, their sculptural presence creates a dynamic visual interplay.<br/><br/>For the candle holders, we designed three sizes that transform iconic crystalline geometries, scaled appropriately and suitably for the tabletop. The cuts and facets of each individual shape vary to manipulate the light each receives uniquely. The candle holders are priced under $200, and offered in three different ambient colorways -- Dark Satin, Golden Shadow, and clear Crystal -- to work in every setting, style and d\u00e9cor. Each piece is a stand-alone statement, when grouped in multiples of shapes and/or colors, they become an animated, shimmering composition.<br/><br/>Our Atelier Swarovski Home Lustra Collection of sophisticated, custom-designed table top objects offers limitless opportunities for both joy and expression. The pieces are architecture that celebrates light and materiality, bringing sculpture to the home at accessible price points. It\u2019s a pure expression of materiality and artistry.",

While specifications are often made based on silhouette, little thought is given to the experience of interaction. The M Series Ergonomic (ME) lever collection changes this paradigm by considering ergonomics, design and experience as one instead of at the expense of the other. <br/><br/>ME1 ergonomic lever <br/>Designed to be soft to the touch from every angle, the ME1 uses gentle curves that contour with the hand for easy actuation. The end of the handle flattens horizontally as it approaches the door, providing a paddle-like surface that - because of its distance from the lever shaft - reduces the amount of force required to open the door.<br/><br/>ME2 architectural ergonomic lever<br/>An architectural interpretation of the ME1 design, a linear, minimalist style integrates into modern aesthetics while delivering comfort, ergonomics and efficiency.<br/><br/>ME3 easy access lever<br/>The slightly larger scale of the ME3 addresses the needs of the growing active aging population. The thicker lever diameter allows easy grasping by arthritic hands, while a lever offset angle positions the large grip surface in a way that reduces actuation force.<br/><br/>The ME Series Schlage levers is the first contract quality handle set that truly addresses how we engage the door - where we approach from any number of directions - and the needs of an active yet aging population were all factored in, resulting in an all new experience.<br/><br/>The ME levers are made of forged brass or bronze and cast in stainless steel. The three handle designs come in the following styles: bright brass, satin brass, bright chrome, polished nickel, satin nickel, matte black.",

The company, which launched in October 2016, offers exclusive, museum-quality limited edition prints by artists hand selected by Twyla\u2019s expert curators. They collaborate with premier artists from around the world, using cutting-edge technology to produce stunning fine art prints that range from $250 to just over $5,000. The company prides itself on their personalized art advisory, framing, packaging and home installation available in over 20 cities. Twyla\u2019s also offers a trade program, where it not only provides its member interior designers and architects a competitive discount on Twyla pieces but also dedicated account managers, access to top curators and complimentary rendering services. <br/><br/>Twyla\u2019s limited edition prints are available in a range of styles, from figurative painting and photography to multimedia collage and abstract works. The company\u2019s international roster of artists have shown in prominent museums and galleries around the world including the Gagosian Gallery, LACMA and The Whitney Museum. <br/><br/>Twyla is dedicated to working with both emerging and established artists, as evident through our unique collections and blue-chip artist releases. In July 2017, Twyla released their first official collection in partnership with Pharrell Williams\u2019 multi-media creative company, i am OTHER. The Twyla x i am OTHER collection includes accessibly priced limited edition prints from M. Tony Peralta, Angelica Hicks and Freegums. Each has a singular voice, but they are connected through their graphic, pop-infused work and unique journeys to becoming artists. <br/><br/>At this year\u2019s Context New York art fair, Twyla debuted a limited edition print from Stanley Casselman\u2019s Luminor series of paintings created in the manner of Gerhard Richter. This series and his Inhaling Richter series followed Casselman\u2019s response to New York Magazine\u2019s art critic Jerry Saltz\u2019s call to artists to paint a \u201cperfect fake\u201d Richter painting. Casselman\u2019s ensuing body of work proved wildly successful, with one piece earning approximately $210,000 at auction. The company is currently working with renowned artist and poet John Giorno to release an exclusive series of signed prints. Giorno has always used his poetry to push beyond the page, and he\u2019s known for transforming his words into ground-breaking performances, installations and multimedia experiences since the 1960s. <br/><br/>Twyla generates a new, incremental revenue stream for its artists through the collaborative creation and sale of fine art editions. Twyla has participated in numerous live artist-led activations at art fairs including Art Wynwood in Miami, interior design fairs including High Point Market in North Carolina and Design Industries Foundation Fighting Aids\u2019 (DIFFA) Dining by Design and design shows including Sight Unseen OFFSITE and Market Art + Design. Twyla differentiates itself from competitors by either participating in art fairs in unexpected ways or participating in engaging experiences outside of the traditional art market, inviting a wider audience to discover and buy contemporary art. Twyla\u2019s exhibits at DIFFA and OFFSITE garnered impressive media attention and positive feedback from both consumers and trade professionals.",

With a passion for water and the often unseen beauty that lies below the surface, Percy sees the maps as a way of connecting people with their environment. <br/><br/>Combining modern surveying techniques and CAD technology with the art of cartography, Pangea Maps are made from layers of plywood. Carefully considering the scale and composition of each map, Percy sources accurate bathymetric data (underwater topography) for each location before laser-cutting the plywood sheets to form the contours of the ocean floor. When finished, each map goes into a hardwood frame and is finished with a layer of glass. Maps are shipped in a beautiful wooden box, making it the perfect gift. <br/><br/>With an early focus on the Australian coastline, in December of 2016 Pangea Maps turned its attention to North America, introducing a new line of maps featuring coastlines and lakes including Vancouver, San Francisco, Los Angeles, the Great Lakes, Boston, and New York. This summer, Tom introduced a new Hamptons map for beach-goers, and this fall he introduced new maps of the Hawaiian Islands, Maui, Santa Barbara, Puget Sound, Nantucket and Nova Scotia for the holidays. Pricing for North American maps start at $360. Australian maps start at $240 and custom maps start at $390.<br/><br/>For each custom map sold, Pangea will donate $50 to the Ocean Cleanup, an organization developing advanced technologies to rid the world\u2019s oceans of plastic, with an aim to clean up 50% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in 5 years.",

After her apprenticeship with Marcel Breuer, her career and work ultimately took her New York City; working on hundreds of projects ranging from Bronx Community College, to Battery Park City, and the renewal of the St Regis Hotel in 1991. Celebrating her memory and designs: Sensitive, beautiful and always with a sense of purpose, NY2O, a family owned company, continue her design centric legacy with ongoing work to honor the precious resource that is water. <br/><br/>Her patented design of the bottle features an impressive groove running along the entire vertical length. The beauty is created with asymmetric dimensional planes. Form following function, beauty was indeed paramount to encourage reuse and sustainability for an everyday product. A sense of duty to the end-user to ensure recycling and find creative uses. This groove presented a design challenge for the label. <br/><br/>Taking inspiration for Esther\u2019s personal collection of colored pencil artwork she created for many decades, the label is a marriage with the design of the bottle. The groove, is an ergonomic masterpiece for a drinking vessel. It also wonderfully bends light. <br/><br/>The label needed to emphasize the bottle, all the while possess meaningful branding. With geometric lines and patterns, it evokes the architecture of New York and at the same time, through the lens of the groove, creates a fluid and always changing landscape that is playful to the eye. Angle and lines are transformed into a prism of imagination. <br/><br/>Two patterns have been designed so far. One consists of diagonal lines that bends to look like wave patterns. The second pattern is a grid, that bends into a shimmering effect of water as seen through crystalline oceans and waterways. <br/><br/>These patterns distortions are unique and purposefully studied. It invites future exploration of design and art, all the while having continuity in product branding. It lends itself to further subtle changes for specific markets and cultures around the globe.",

The piece is a monolith capped with a glass cylinder, which the undulating top part puts a delicate and mysterious veil on the scented candle. Just like a piedestal, the base in refined marble (Portoro, Saint Laurent, Paonazzo or Statuary marble) emphasizes the scented candle by giving it its height and nice presence, whilst the tinted glass cylinder (dark grey, bronze, blue or white colored glass) is a fragrance diffuser as well as a second skin.

A lovely Charles homemade patina was applied on the trunk sculpture to enhance its texture details. 6 different leaf models were created to set a tree of 437 leaves made from brass casting. Each of the leaves were polished, gilded, manually burnished and mounted one by one according to the traditional way of bronze fitting in order to give to the future generations the opportunity to repair or restore the piece. The soil and the sand were also sculptured by hand, then gilded and burnished with Agatha stone. As for the pot, it\u2019s a original and traditional bonsai pot in terracotta, made by a Japanese potter.

These stunning designs respond to market demand for high-performance sound control products that stand out yet blend in for all the right reasons: they resemble decorative architecture. <br/><br/>It\u2019s easy to mistake Zintra Cloud for artwork hanging from the ceiling. The two new styles, Giffard and Blanchard, feature elliptical and diamond constructions with openings to let light pass through for an airy, light feel.<br/><br/>The two new patterns of Zintra Texture, Trappe and Tissage, pop out from the wall to create a dynamic, three-dimensional ambiance. The raised designs bring texture and dimension to commercial spaces and add a touch of natural elegance, resembling a stone path and woven basket. <br/><br/>Zintra on Zintra now offers a range of 20 dimensional designs that can be used for entire walls, paneling, desk dividers and concertina screens. These are created from two Zintra panels: one of which has the design cut out allowing the back panel of color to show through. <br/><br/>In the Zintra on Zintra Concertina design, the Zintra on Zintra panels connect with flexible straps to form lightweight, portable partitions. No assembly required; just stand it up and adjust the angles to suit. When it\u2019s no longer needed, simply fold flat and store it away. Available in hundreds of options and tone-on-tone or two-tone combinations, the Concertina screens are an all-in-one sound absorbing, flexible partitioning solution that look just as good as they perform. <br/><br/>New and improved, Zintra Acoustic Baffles makes installation and assembly even easier. The new format allows for more organic, free-form structures with a different aesthetic. Gorge, the first in the new range, features an asymmetrical profile and perforated accents.<br/><br/>Zintra is 100 percent polyester and has a Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) rating of 0.26 to 0.95, depending on the design. The refreshed line gives designers even more creativity with updated colors, lines, shapes and functionality, while remaining a durable and effective noise solution for commercial settings. <br/><br/>Solid, unformed Zintra Acoustical solutions include half inch construction in 4-foot by 9-foot long panels as well as one-eighth inch flexible rolls of 4-foot wide material. Zintra Acoustic offers a range of colors from classic neutrals to bright limes and yellows or custom colors. More options? Choose to digitally print a graphic with Acoustic Zintra. The cost-effective sound solution for walls, panels and ceilings is easily fabricated and installed.",

Snowsound Art displays Gillo Dorfles\u2019 designs and serves as an example of how a dialog between art an industry is necessary and should be the basis for any mass-produced product. In our case, Dorfles participated in all phases of the project, from concept to creation. <br/><br/>Gillo Dorfles has always conceived and created books, exhibitions, cultural events, and, most of all, his paintings, doing so with a penchant for mass production. The work of art is always unique; however, the ability to reproduce it using old or new techniques knows no bounds. This is where Dorfles' openness to the world and his ability to always stay in step with the times comes from. He worked with the curator of his exhibitions, Luigi Sansone, to choose four designs created between 1937 and 1998, which he has lent to this series of Snowsound panels.<br/><br/>Dorfles is distinguished as the oldest living art critic at 107 years old. Born in Trieste, Italy in 1910, the painter and artist was a contemporary of Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. He founded the \"Movimento Arte Concreta\" (MAC) with Monnet, Soldati and Munari in 1948. He is considered one of the foremost art scholars in the world.<br/><br/>The acoustic panels are 63\" x 48\" or 48\" x 48\" and only 1.4\" thick. The outer panel cover is durable, Trevira CS\u00ae polyester fabric. The art pattern is durably ink-jet printed. Each Snowsound\u00ae panel is constructed with 100% recyclable polyester and is Greenguard Gold certified. The patented variable density composition meets Class A sound absorption with an NRC of 1.0. Panels have been UL Class A fire and smoke safety tested. Wall brackets and aircraft cable ceiling mounting options are available. Steel frame kits for ceiling mounting include plates and cables.

The clever slotted design allows modules to fit together and hold securely with just the friction of the material and mounts to vertical surfaces with magnetic attachment hardware. The acoustically effective, three-dimensional modules come in two sizes and 63 colorways of wool felt to create customizable patterning. The standard dark grey substrate color is intended to create a shadow line and emphasize the three-dimensionality. Scale modules are 100% VOC free and free of harmful substances while the fiber composite is 100% recyclable and the wool felt facing is 100% biodegradable.<br/><br/>In the summer of 2014, an interior design session at the University of Applied Sciences Mainz in Germany brought sixteen students together to investigate, experiment, and collaborate on the design possibilities of textile fiber composites. Their hard work and sharp investigative skills paid o in a wide range of designs. One design by Vanessa Busemann and Felix Zebi was Scale\u2014a modular, plug-in system of cut and folded acoustic scales. The product was exhibited at the International Furniture Fair in Cologne, Germany and the Dutch Design Week in Eindhoven, Netherlands and was wildly well received. Their instructor, Professor Bernd Benninghoff, saw the potential (and had three partners that could put the designs into production) and Cabs Design was born. This German design collective focuses on German-made acoustic fiber composite and 100% wool felt in innovative and unexpected acoustic products.",

The collection includes two new acoustic fixtures \u2014 Static and Echo \u2014 that each provide an architectural lighting solution, sound absorption, and natural texture to effectively create a new category of lighting possibilities. <br/><br/>Static is a beam-shaped modular lighting solution that delivers both high performance lighting and acoustic value. Using some of the highest efficiency LED modules on the market, Static offers two directional lighting and has 1% dimming capabilities. Echo, a fixture consisting of a series of angled fins, is intended to be specified as a system of fixtures to create a striking geometric ceiling landscape with the unique ability to provide both a lighting and sound solution.<br/><br/>While LightArt traditionally uses 3form materials, the Acoustic Collection features a new material for the first time in the company\u2019s eleven year history \u2014 50% recycled PET felt \u2014 a material that provides a contemporary aesthetic while adding softness and texture to overhead lighting. LightArt tested the acoustic performance of the material at the largest reverberation chamber in the world - NWAA Labs in Elma, Washington. Static\u2019s material and assembly received an NRC rating ranging from .80 to 1.00, proving the fixture\u2019s high performance capabilities. <br/><br/>Lighting offers an opportunity to put an acoustic solution closer to the source of sound, which increases the efficiency of the absorption, while also offering a more seamless way to integrate solutions into the environment. Both Static and Echo can be arrayed for significant absorption coverage in spaces where poor acoustics can be distracting such as open workplace environments, conference rooms, classrooms and restaurants. This new line of high performance lighting aims to help designers improve communication, enhance interactions and create harmony in active environments.",

Acoustic engineers assisted in the design challenge of reducing noise in the open office, targeting the workstation itself. Advanced sound absorbent materials were used to provide noise comfort, while a stylish retro design fits perfectly in the modern office. ThinkingQuietly gives peace at last. Time to get thinking!<br/><br/>ThinkingQuietly Workstations create solitude for up to six users while maintaining a polished, well-analyzed design. Workstations feature contemporary desk pads made of signature noise-cancelling acoustic material. A solid wood Y-frame creates an overhead umbrella that traps sound as it naturally travels upward. Mobile briefcases also function as storage and power can be placed between units to partition individual users in moments that call for confidentiality, without subtracting from collaboration and communication vital to success in today\u2019s office. The 4-person workstation with an acoustic umbrella provides up to 44% improvement over standard stations with screens.<br/><br/>ThinkingQuietly's signature acoustic material is produced from recycled plastic that is crushed and spun into fibers that form the felt based material. The pressure die cast aluminum components that form framework are manufactured from 40% post-consumer aluminum. The solid oak used to manufacture the legs, canopy frame and desktop accessories are sourced from environmentally responsible suppliers who harvest the material from renewable forests. <br/><br/>ThinkingQuietly is also an optimal choice for libraries and information centers where solitude is sought. Cable trays utilize the acoustical material to conceal power and data, reducing floor level noise. Integrated task lights give users control over lighting, and ultimately their personal work environment. Beautifully finished from top to bottom, ThinkingQuietly is a clear choice.<br/><br/>ThinkingQuietly introduces an inventive solution to the growing challenge of common space noise. As a national trend, office real estate is shrinking. Businesses are answering this, coupled with research demanding team collaboration and communication, by opting for open office plans as opposed to private offices. A growing amount of people operating together in a single space permits collaboration and free-flowing ideas, but also produces considerable sound pressure in high-traffic areas. To combat the problem of noisy open offices without subtracting from team tasking, ThinkingQuietly integrates acoustic noise-cancelling elements into a brilliant benching design.<br/><br/>An array of options including desk pads and overhead umbrellas canvased in exclusive acoustic material cancels noise in a busy office space and gives users privacy for confidential phone calls, or lets them escape the noise and focus on personal tasks. ThinkingQuietly gives an unparalleled, ultra-attractive solution to open office environments in need of synergy with a side privacy.<br/><br/>Acoustic engineers have advised the design of ThinkingQuietly. In an open office environment, workers often leave their area in search of a vacant room or quiet spot to escape noise and distractions. ThinkingWorks gives acoustic relief to open office workers seeking quiet privacy to focus without sacrificing openness.",

When one goes outside after a snowfall, it is extremely peaceful and quiet. The combination of the DIESIS drape structure, the air gaps created by the curves in the design, and the patented textile weave of the fabric work together to create similar effect to snowfall in reducing reverberation.<br/>Modern interiors often employ hard walls, floors and ceiling materials, creating unwanted reverberation. Snowsound-Fiber solutions can be designed into the project at the planning phase or post-occupancy, acoustically correcting spaces while adding visually interesting aesthetics.<br/>These innovative, patented acoustic structures can be creatively clustered and positioned to create dramatic, colorful designs. The structures are available in various designer colors.<br/>Due to rigorous R&amp;D and unique methodology in weaving the polyester threads into the finished textile, Snowsound-Fiber possesses acoustical properties unlike other fabrics on the market. The fabric is designed to primarily absorb mid-range and low-range frequencies while reflecting some high-range waves for proper acoustic balance. <br/>Snowsound-Fiber products are standard GreenGuard Gold certified for commercial use which helps acquiring credits in the LEED buildings assessment system, as well as meeting Class A Fire and Smoke safe per UL Standards. <br/>Installing DIESIS structures can correct acoustic reverberation in built environments, where retrofitting existing walls and ceilings is often not desirable. Rigid panels may not always be compatible with interior design visions, especially when the designer is looking for more free form fabric like textures. DIESIS would provide the designer with the ability to integrate more free form objects into the environment while making a significant impact in improving the sound quality of the space. <br/>These drape structures are constructed with a patented composition of interwoven, polyester, fire resistant fiber. The use of Silver ions in fiber threads make the finished material completely bacteriostatic. The Snowsound-Fiber textile can be easily removed from the structure and machine washed (140\u00b0F), ironed (max 240\u00b0F) and reattached without losing its fire-resistant and acoustic properties or its shape. DIESIS is built to last for many years with high-quality materials and a lifetime warranty for manufacturing defects. <br/>DIESIS uses patented Snowsound-Fiber technology that begins with unique polyester threads and a patented weave to create a completely unique textile. This yields a fabric that is much more acoustically effective in absorbing sound than other polyester fabrics on the market. DIESIS as an object is innovative as it leverages the Snowsound-Fiber textile with precise ratios of air gaps between layers of fabric, which were scientifically calculated to achieve comparable 1.0 NRC sound absorption to traditional Snowsound panels. Designers are requesting thinner ways and lighter ways to address the acoustics of the space and were finding that standard fabrics are not working as acoustic solutions. Now an equal alternative to acoustic panels, Snowsound-Fiber offers a textile structure that is unmatched in absorbing performance, aesthetics, design flexibility, durability and ease of installation.",

It is available in two styles: BuzziPleat Ripple and BuzziPleat Edel.<br/><br/>Blending beauty and performance into one adaptable collection, these large-scale, yet lightweight sculptural pendants are innovative for their unorthodox stylistic -- and in turn, functional\u2014influences. Made of sound-absorbing BuzziFelt, the BuzziPleat series features reinterpreted ancient techniques used in fashion design, like smocking and pleating, to maximize surface area, allowing both configurations to deliver exceptional acoustic performance.<br/><br/>Specifically, the traditional craft of hand pleating\u2014the principle of gathering up volume, then reining it in\u2014is applied to freely construct a complex architectural form. The BuzziPleat framework relies on tension of its own fabrication, rather than an internal support structure. Fashion has long adopted this method to create neat, yet flexible forms. Here, the application brings an organic quality to an otherwise synthetic material.<br/><br/>\u201cPleating brings movement to still objects, animating them from within,\u201d said Martin Lesjak, lead architect and designer, 13&amp;9. \u201cIt can therefore be seen as the symbol of a major social shift towards a rebounding society giving movement and elasticity to structure.\u201d<br/><br/>In addition to serving as an acoustic solution, BuzziPleat can also be configured with an optional light source add-on to marry sound control and illumination into one multi-purpose product. Both configurations in the series can be affixed to a wall or suspended from the ceiling, and come in two available sizes: a 100 cm or 150 cm diameter. Users can also choose from a range of BuzziFelt and BuzziFabric combinations, ranging from neutral tones to bright hues, so that their BuzziPleat model can meet the individual aesthetic needs of any given space.<br/><br/>BuzziPleat represents BuzziSpace\u2019s continued commitment to acoustic solutions for the workplace, as well as for commercial spaces, hospitality settings, and more. From a larger perspective, however, BuzziPleat also represents the brand\u2019s evolution towards highly functional designs that meet the increasingly dynamic needs of work and life, without sacrificing the refined aesthetics that make BuzziSpace\u2019s products so versatile and universally appealing. By fusing exceptional acoustic performance \u2013 a hallmark of the brand\u2013 with a dual-function form that can serve both as a lighting fixture and eye-catching focal point, BuzziPleat is a synthesis of BuzziSpace\u2019s rich history in acoustic design, and its continued commitment to reimagining designs to be more functional and fun.",

In keeping with this approach, the company partnered with architect Bjarne Hammer of the renowned Danish practice of Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects to create Heartfelt. The product subsequently won a Best of the Best award in the category of Product Design from the Red Dot Institute, earning this elite designation out of more than 5,500 entries from 54 countries in 2017.<br/><br/>Patented HeartFelt linear panels, created from felted, thermoformed polyester, can accommodate the design of any interior space to create a new generation of ceilings and walls. The unique texture and soft appearance that have long made felt an intriguing material for furniture, clothing, fashion accessories and interior finishes can also translate directly to the ceiling or wall plane.<br/><br/>\u201cFelt is fantastic to work with if you\u2019re an architect,\u201d said Hammer. \u201cIt\u2019s a material that stirs emotion\u2026 It\u2019s playful.\u201d<br/><br/>HeartFelt linear panels bring the organic appearance of felt to the ceiling and wall, adding warmth to the visual and acoustical experiences of a space. Designers and architects can use the system to create intriguing aesthetics for both work and play environments.<br/><br/>The panels are available in seven shades of grey (white, off-white, middle grey, dark grey, anthracite, and black) and five earth tones (cr\u00e8me, light brown, middle brown, dark brown, and umber) offering opportunities to create visual gradients and rhythms for ceilings and walls. <br/><br/>The dense, soft structure contributes to sound control and acoustical management to facilitate clear communication. Hunter Douglas designed the patented carrier system to support varying panel spacing, which allows architects and designers to fine-tune acoustics, helping create pleasant and productive work and learning spaces. <br/><br/>The lightweight HeartFelt panels easily clip onto the carriers and can be installed as a wall, a ceiling cloud or as a full ceiling by splicing individual pieces to create continuous lengths.<br/><br/>\u201cToday, delivering high-quality, sustainable products is expected.

The wall-mounted radiator comprises two 30mm diameter stainless steel pipes that come together to form a \u201cY\u201d. Housekeeping can stack fresh, folded or rolled towels into the upper area of the \u201cY\u201d so they are heated upon guests\u2019 arrival. The slant of the pipes and their snug fit against the wall ensures remaining towels stay securely in place as guests take one from the pile. Four discreet hooks on the parallel stems of the lower section provide additional storage options to warm hanging towels and are angled to echo the shape of the top part of the \u201cY\u201d, adding a sense of symmetry and continuity.<br/><br/>The innovative profile excels on both functional and aesthetic levels. Its modern and elegant contouring is very different from the classic ladder radiator, making it stand out as an object of interest as well as an efficient product. Energy-saving technology reduces operational costs with 120 watts used to generate a maximum surface temperature of 110\u00b0F.<br/><br/>Whilst radiators are often seen as a necessity, this fixture\u2019s unique shape encourages venues to instead consider it as a design object. A wide spectrum of finishes such as polished stainless steel, orange peel, bronze, European bronze, copper, black pearl, gold PVD, gold and white RAL9003 means the heater can complement any color palette and become a highlight within the interiors instead of merely a functional requirement.",

            "description_html": "KALLISTA has once again collaborated with internationally renowned designer Laura Kirar with a new bath vanity, mirror and sconces that marries the beauty of natural elements with the balanced pureness of line and symmetry. Her latest endeavor underscores her love of natural materials and how she incorporates this passion into her design aesthetic. It is also stands testament to how her KALLISTA designs complement her earlier collections for a remarkable range of choices from this designer. <br/><br/>Explained Kirar, \u201cI sought simplicity in materials and to highlight the purity of form. The vanity focuses on the texture of the wood grain, simple book-matching and an interior design, flexible geometry. The mirror needed to be only about glass, reflection and light \u2013 so the shape is simple but the faceting unique, reflecting the environment in interesting ways. The materials and form of the lighting is all about softness and even illumination with a little decorative jewelry that matches the Pinna Paletta and Paletta Pure fixtures.\u201d <br/>The new vanity reflects Laura\u2019s ability to mix mediums for a look that is decidedly fresh and of the moment. \u201cI think the contrast for me is registered as a sensory experience,\u201d Kirar explains. \u201cIt's an inviting mix of stone: smooth, soft, and cool to the touch, with the textural warmth of wood.\u201d<br/><br/>The vanity is available with either Calacatta Borghini marble top rich with grey veining or Nero Marquina marble with its stark white veining. The vanity cabinetry is available in a golden Cerused Oak or in glossy White Lacquer. \u201cI've always found an attraction to white oak for its strong yet soft textural quality,\u201d said Kirar. \u201cWith the addition of a coursed finish, it has greater interest and depth.\u201d<br/><br/>The cabinet is fitted with two pull-out, slow close drawers that discreetly open from the side and offer ample storage for life\u2019s incidentals. The cabinet is raised on two smooth, straight solid cast brass legs that can be customized in a jewelry cut foot to match Kirar\u2019s Pinna Paletta or Vir Stil collections and available in Antique American Bronze, Unlacquered Brass, Nickel Silver, Antique Nickel Silver and Polished Chrome KALLISTA living finishes. <br/><br/>The quiet sophistication of Kirar\u2019s product designs are also reflected in her new KALLISTA mirror and sconce. Compatible with LED lights, the distinctive, 30-inch-high mirror combines crystal clear glass with a cool metal frame. The frame has canted corners breaking the smooth sides in chic contrast and surrounds a beveled mirror that stands slightly proud from the mirror frame. The cylinder-shaped glass sconces can be configured either flanking a mirror, or in singular fashion residing above the mirror allowing the light to cascade down its length. The shade is supported by twin solid cast brass supports that can be customized with jewelry cut medallions to match the Pinna Paletta or Vir Stil collections and offered in customer\u2019s choice of Antique American Bronze, Unlacquered Brass, Nickel Silver, Antique Nickel Silver and Polished Chrome KALLISTA living finishes.",

Adding a dimmer switch gives you even more control over your lighting and the atmosphere of the room. An electrical outlet included within the medicine cabinet gives you more convenience when getting ready for your day. So if your daily routine includes primping, plucking, shaving, brushing or applying makeup, install a Verdera lighted mirror or medicine cabinet and see yourself in a whole new light.<br/>The design of this high quality mirror with LED technology embedded behind the glass allows for effortless cleaning and robust performance in humid bathroom environments. The 90CRI LED assembly with improved optics provides 1500 lumens of light focused on the user with perfect diffusion and edge to edge illuminance so there are no hot spots or dark spots. Verdera Lighted has an approximately 3,000 Kelvin light appearance that delivers a neutral light ideal for overall bathroom aesthetics as well as tasks (lower Kelvin has yellow tint; higher Kelvin have bluer tint). Verdera Lighted's minimum 90 CRI lets you see yourself in the truest light - the closest thing to natural light on the market - for makeup application, grooming, and skin care. <br/>The Verdera medicine cabinet can be surface-mounted, cutting down on the time and work required for installation. It is essentially the same process as hanging a picture frame, as opposed to the bottom-up installation required for most cabinets.<br/>The easy installation makes the cabinet ideal for both DIY and professional installation projects. Several of the cabinet models can open with a left- or right-hand swing for more space-planning options. And the cabinets can also be recess-mounted.<br/><br/>Verdera medicine cabinets and mirrors are available in a wide range of sizes and options. They\u2019re made with rust-free aluminum-ideal for moist bathroom environments. They also offer high-end features such as slow-close hinges, which prevent the door from slamming, and outlets within the medicine cabinet for added convenience.

The two companies\u2019 shared passion for excellence and desire to blend creativity and technology brought them together for a completely original expression of water in metal and marble.<br/><br/>Designed by Elisa Ossino, Fontane Bianche stunningly fuses the natural elements of stone and water. The design arose from research into archetypal forms, such as in Greek mythology, which were then translated into geometric precision and reinterpreted in a contemporary vein. A dialogue between circle and square runs through the entire collection \u2013 a metaphor for the relationship between psyche and material. <br/><br/>The washbasin, for example, is created from a square marble block, from which a circular hemisphere is extracted. Featuring a slim, curved 90 degree shape, the tap is evocative of the radius of the washbasin itself, and the controls reference once more the relationship of circle and square.<br/><br/>The purity of the forms is embellished by rich materials \u2013 marble and stone for the washbasins and gun metal finish for the taps. Translated as \u201cWhite Fountain,\u201d Fontane Bianche takes its name from an area with white sands in Sicily, so-called on account of numerous natural freshwater fountains gushing out of the sea.",

            "description_html": "To replicate the gentle building of a rain storm, Real Rain is designed with a water reservoir that relies on gravity at its core rather than a pressurized spray to shape the individual drops of a rainfall. When the reservoir fills, water spills into the remainder of the showerhead, covering 775 nozzles. Gravity does its job, and raindrops begin to fall softly, slowly through concave nozzles. They grow in strength and speed until the shower feels, sounds and looks like a warm summer rain. In our exploration of rain, we wanted to push the design a bit further and capture that moment in a storm when the sky opens in a sudden energetic burst of heavy rain. The deluge feature is designed to store a gallon of water while the primary rain feature is running. And then, with the push of a button, an exhilarating deluge of water is released in a warm drenching burst, a half-gallon of water pouring over you for eight seconds. A byproduct of the reservoir design, the nozzles at the center of the showerhead are engaged only when the deluge feature is operating. This allows us to provide a circular, rain-free zone for the face, allowing the person to stay within the experience. Real Rain is a truly unique take on how we use water to create desirable experiences. Real Rain is a testament to what can be achieved when we ask the right questions and deliver authentic answers to those questions; not the easy, fast, or preconceived answers. While aesthetically intriguing, the real design of this product is about the experience that it gives, it's about the visceral reaction one gets, it's about fostering a mental transportation and respite from the day's stresses. Rain's natural feel is deeply intertwined with our humanity. Because of the reservoir and gravity dynamic, we also are able to provide the full experience of a rainfall while keeping the water use to an exceptionally efficient 2.0 gallons per minute. Thinking beyond traditional pressurized sprays, Real Rain's use of gravity allows the water experience to be spread over a large surface area to create a warm enveloping rainfall. Other traditional overhead sprays may use up to 4 times as much water to produce a standard pressurized shower. The other unique element of a gravity fed rain is that the water's heat energy transfer to the skin is dramatically better than the traditional sprays. Traditional sprays; because of their velocity tend to ricochet off the skin, while gravity fed droplets softly land on the skin efficiently transferring most of their heat to the person. This allows less water to be used while not sacrificing the comfort and cleansing functionality of a proper showering experience. At Kohler, we are very cognizant of water's preciousness and continually seek ways of delivering unique experiences with minimal ecological impact. With this always in mind, innovations like Real Rain are fostered and allowed to be realized.",

Paying homage to 1950s and 1960s design that moved away from the complex fluting or layered details of earlier periods, Per Se is an attractive alternative of fashionable understatement. <br/><br/>The Per Se Sink Faucet began as a sketch, and proved to be a challenging engineering feat. The in-house design features an ultra-thin, appealing rectangular shape that does not compromise quality by retaining standard wall thickness. It also incorporates an almost imperceptible valve to reduce the overall mass as much as possible. The faucet offers soft, quiet water delivery without splashing. The design is an environmentally sound choice for the home, meeting the flow, force and coverage EPA WaterSense\u00ae listed criteria with a 1.5 gpm laminar flow aerator. Kallista utilizes the finest valves in its faucets to ensure years of maintenance-free use. Featuring quarter-turn, diamond-hard washerless ceramic disc valves instead of conventional seat washers assure that the installation will be leak-free even in the hardest water conditions. The Per Se Sink Faucet is available in Polished Chrome, Nickel Silver, Black Nickel and Polished Gold KALLISTA living finishes, which naturally oxidize adding unique warmth and character to the form over time. <br/><br/>Flanking the Per Se Sink Faucet are the new Per Se Clear Crystal Knob Handles. A collaboration with Cristallerie Royale de Saint-Louis (Saint-Louis) of France creates this luxurious in-house designed option to the Per Se decorative handle selection. The one-of-a-kind Per Se Clear Crystal Knobs are handcrafted by Saint-Louis artisans, an appointment not easily achieved as each must apprentice for 10 years at a minimum before joining its illustrious team of master glass blowers and cutters. Renowned for its crystal works since the early 19th century, Saint-Louis continues to create rarified designs using the same Old World techniques of hand blowing and hand etching that have been passed down from generation to generation. The hand-cut and polished stacked crystal knobs reflect a pure beauty with a sparkling jewel-like appearance that complements the metal base offered in Polished Chrome, Nickel Silver, Black Nickel and Polished Gold KALLISTA living finishes.",

The faucet is offered in two styles \u2013 a low spout, a perfectly scaled design that features a slightly curved neck, and an arch spout, which true to its name, is a graceful, sweeping gooseneck. These timeless silhouettes have a soft flaring spout for a lush release of water, with stylized sides that soften as they taper along the faucet neck before terminating to the slightly stepped and inverted base. Also from the Script Decorative collection are the enameled decorative lever and cross handles in the shades of white Frost Wave, smoky Flannel Grey Wave, iridescent Celeste Blue Wave, and multi-colored Spring Rain. Reminiscent of the finely detailed enamel and cloisonn\u00e9 jewelry made popular in the 19th century Victorian era, the same techniques are used to design these artful handles. The mold design is hand-painted and fired four times to seal the colors and impart its glossy finish. The Frost Wave, Flannel Grey Wave, and Celeste Blue versions are decorated by a fluid series of lines that follow the handle\u2019s form and a shimmering, shifting coloration that reflects light as it travels across the surface.

The faucet collection is offered in both bathroom and kitchen styles; kitchen faucets offer modern functionality in a traditional design and bathroom offering brings a new level of personalization to the space through choices in spouts and handles. The Artifacts collection extension brings to market a kitchen bridge faucet, a bathroom flute spout and the collection\u2019s foray into lighting. <br/><br/>The Artifacts bridge faucet is a chic twist on a classic, turn-of-the century design; it conveys a striking style that is both nostalgic and modern. The deck-mount bridge faucet comes in four models: one for kitchen sinks and a more compact style for secondary or bar sinks, and both can employ either lever or six-prong handles. The faucet features a matching dual-function sidespray that offers both the powerful Sweep spray for cleaning and the gentler BerrySoft spray options for fast, convenient rinsing of fruits and vegetables. KOHLER\u2019s proprietary ProMotion technology employs a quiet braided hose and swiveling ball joint to make sidespray usage uncomplicated and comfortable. And the kitchen sink faucet has a tall swing spout that rotates a full 360 degrees, providing the necessary clearance to allow for easy filling and cleaning of larger pots.<br/><br/>The Artifacts flume spout and cross handle additions provide consumers with expanded spout and handle options in the bathroom collection allow for a unique personalization. The bathroom sink spout has an open flume design that channels water beautifully into a graceful, elegant waterfall. The cross handles feature easy-to-install and leak-free UltraGlide\u2122 valves.<br/><br/>Artifact\u2019s foray into lighting comes in the form of three sconces: single wall, double wall, and single wall sconce with adjustable cord. True to the original inspiration of this collection, the new sconces are reminiscent of antique candle lanterns, paying homage to the vintage industrial trend.",

Radically thinning the spout and creating an ultra-thin, planar \u201cfloating\u201d handle achieves the intended sleek and ethereal vision. <br/><br/>Morro Bay\u2019s \"floating\" handle, which operates completely independently of the faucet body, presents a groundbreaking design feature in the single-hole faucet category. Streamlined and elegantly modern, the handle gently sails above the body, versus moving along with a heavy, cumbersome hub. With its handle that operates as a \u201cfree spirit,\u201d Morro Bay creates the illusion of a thin, narrow rectangle balancing on end atop the faucet as if on a fulcrum. And by intentionally omitting the extraneous, the design exudes a Zen-like simplicity that makes Morro Bay as much a mini modern sculpture as it is a faucet. <br/><br/>As with all of California Faucets bath fittings, the Morro Bay single-lever faucet is constructed of solid brass and is available in more than 30 artisan finishes which include 15 PVD finishes that are guaranteed for life against tarnishing.",

This stylish model saves precious space in the bathroom as its DuoFit In-Wall Tank System is concealed along with the mounting bolts and connection for its Connect+ D-Shaped WASHLET bidet seat. Lifted from the floor, the wall-mount MH Connect+ HET makes cleaning beneath a simple and easy. This versatile unit may be mounted at standard or Universal Height.<br/><br/>The Connect+ D-Shaped WASHLET bidet seat offers warm aerated water to cleanse and warm air to dry. Activated by a simple touch of its silver wireless remote, users control the temperature and pressure of the soothing warm aerated water, self-cleaning dual-action spray wand, heated seat, warm air dryer, and built-in deodorizing system. The D-shaped design of its contoured heated seat offers maximum comfort, and its SoftClose lid closes gently after use, eliminating toilet seat slam. <br/><br/>The MH Connect+ HET's vitreous china bowl is coated with CeFiONtect, TOTO\u2019s nano-technology glaze that seals the porcelain with an ionized barrier. This creates a super-slippery, non-porous surface that repels visible and invisible waste. When protected by CeFiONtect, the water that cleanses the bowl and rim during the flush also removes waste, stains, residue, and limescale buildup. Owners will need fewer harsh detergents when cleaning the bowl, which are expensive and harmful to the planet. <br/><br/>The Connect+ D-Shaped WASHLET offers TOTO\u2019s proprietary Premist technology, which helps keep the toilet\u2019s bowl clean by pre-misting it with tap water prior to use. Pre-misting the bowl prevents matter from adhering to its surface approximately 80% better than dry porcelain.<br/><br/>Inspired by nature's tornados, TOTO engineers harnessed the power of gravity and water to spin away waste by designing a seamless bowl interior with a concave rim to channel high-speed water jets. Each flush effectively removes matter, debris, stains, residue, and limescale, as it provides superior bowl and rim cleansing action.<br/><br/> The new MH Connect+ wall-mount toilet provides interior designers and consumers with a chic, metropolitan design option that is at home in a variety of bathroom interiors and is ideal for a powder room or small bath.",

This 66-inch copper bathtub is distinguished by its pedestal base and the juxtaposition between its graceful lines and hand-hammered texture. Through thousands of hammer strikes and over the course of weeks, the work of master coppersmiths is reflected in Santorini, as are centuries of artisan techniques that have been passed down and continually refined while honoring the company\u2019s commitment to sustainability.<br/><br/> \u201cThis bathtub has been designed to be as timeless as the material from which it\u2019s made,\u201d says Naomi Neilson Howard, founder and CEO of Native Trails. \u201cThe curves that our artisans have hammered into place by hand cut a classic figure\u2014at once elegant and stately, and very versatile stylistically depending on its surroundings. With Santorini, our design team achieved a beautiful bathtub that will endure the test of time.\u201d<br/><br/>Santorini\u2019s versatile look can skew rustic, classic, or glamorous depending on whether the chosen finish is polished or antiqued \u2013 or luxuriously plated in nickel. In the Brushed Nickel finish, Santorini benefits from the latest plating innovations. The advanced electroless plating process gives extreme surface adhesion and ensures that every surface is evenly coated in uniform thickness. Used regularly for mining and aerospace applications, the electroless plating process also provides superior wear and corrosion resistance. <br/><br/>Copper\u2019s versatility is shown in its ability to be formed, stretched and hammered into sheets without breaking. Beyond the distinctive texture and magnificent coloration, recycled copper is extraordinary in the field of sustainability. Less energy is used to recycle the material than to extract, mine or originally produce it, and copper is one of the few materials in the world that retains its performance even with repeated recycling.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, Santorini instantly ups a bathroom\u2019s luxury quotient and instills it with a sense of history, necessitating long, lazy soaks that, quite naturally, make bathers feel like royalty. As homeowners increasingly look to create master bathrooms that double as luxurious retreats where they can unplug, trendspotters are linking the soaking tub\u2019s resurgence as a kind of real-life antidote to our hectic digital lives.<br/><br/>The Santorini is Native Trails\u2019 first bathtub to be offered in its new Polished Copper finish, which debuted earlier this year. This luxe shade carries hints of rose gold and is hand-polished to a dazzling shine. Santorini\u2019s gleaming finish introduces contemporary bling to a bathroom while paying homage to the copper bathtub\u2019s European heritage and generations of Mexican artisanship. Today, this 100 percent high-quality recycled copper tub is helping designers around the world create one-of-a-kind eco-chic spaces.",

The nervous system is stimulated and react to either a density of color or pattern that inspires movement across the floor surface, or gathering towards a collaborative meeting or focus point. Active provides opportunities for zoning, wayfinding, and activity-based delineation in the workplace. Scale and impact can be manipulated through mixing both styles and colors.<br/><br/>Active offers four unique styles ranging from a subtle texture, to crisp, graphic high-visibility linear pattern. We treat these design tools \u2013 pattern and color to promote pathways, shape visual cues to create intuitive experiences. The patterns can build into bold statements with neutral breaks. Clean neutrals and bold color can shift from small proportion to large scale for flexible environments. Constructed with EcoWorx backing &amp; Eco Solution Q nylon, Active has superior durability, style and recyclability. The Shaw Contract lifetime commercial limited warranty covers abrasive wear, tuft-bind, edge ravel and delamination.<br/><br/>From the concept development stage, our design team was inspired by activewear, focusing on modes of activity and wellness for color and pattern, and the shift towards \u2018athleisure.' We envisioned how the synthesis of pattern, texture, shape and color can be used to truly activate a space. We also looked at the language around race trace tracks, whose lines shape and guide runners. Three new fluorescent colors were developed for this collection and added to our color library. There were strategic pile height plantings in the pattern to manipulate the machine into creating a cleaner look. <br/><br/>Our flooring designers were drawn to these emerging lifestyle trends. Early in the process, they studied athletic apparel, where they were engaged in patterns that integrated to fit the purpose of its user. As with athletic apparel design, our designers\u2019 perspective was to envision how pattern, texture, shape and color can be used to activate an interior space. <br/><br/>The result of this study was a collection of custom tufted carpets available in fields, corridors and rugs. These sweeping, overscale graphic patterns provide a fresh design perspective. Likewise, the color palette reflects this wellness-conscious trend with a base of neutral grays accented with graphic pops of melon. <br/><br/>The manufacturing technology allows precision pattern details, which is evident in the carpets\u2019 designs that mimic the detailed form and function of athletic wear. The collection is tufted with four solution dyed nylon colors; yet, the the tufting technology allows yarn colors to be combined, giving the appearance of multiple colors.<br/> <br/>Certified Cradle to Cradle\u00a9 Silver &amp; assessed for impact on health + the environment.

A geometric splicing of color and interlocking structures create dynamic forms that provide familiar structure to the floor. Nuanced gradation and edge-transitions fuse texture, pattern, and color for a graceful asymmetry that maximizes spatial flexibility. The resulting harmony invites us to flourish in our daily experience, striking an essential balance between technology, nature, and our true selves.<br/><br/>The human journey is intrinsically linked to technology. Chaotic or arranged, our lives merge natural and man-made influences. We respond with a desire for balance as personal and collective needs morph with new definitions of purpose; we redefine the connections between people, nature, and technology to reflect our individuality. <br/><br/>Immix explores this trichotomy through blending bold geometry and flowing organics, softened through new design innovations and industry-leading digital dye injection technology \u2013 proprietary tools only through which such heightened dimensionality is possible.<br/><br/>Various design elements enhance the flexibility of Immix with several avenues to create multiple dimensionalities: two distinct pattern groupings, edge transition capabilities, and four textured bases. <br/><br/>Two pattern groupings evolve complementary aesthetics in large, medium and small scales. Vertex, a geometry expression for where two or more lines meet, interprets where humanity, technology, and nature collide. Graphic and dimensional, scales of intricate hexagonal shapes warp and spiral to achieve a modern, innovative dimensionality on the floor. Flourish highlights the outcome when various facets of one\u2019s surrounding influences meet and connect in harmony. The progression of Vertex into a series of patterns that are more organic, Flourish illustrates the positive effect of one embracing technology in a way that fits his or her world, not defines.<br/><br/>Milliken\u2019s signature nuanced gradation and edge transition capabilities fuse texture, pattern, and color for eloquent design transitions in an interior. Four levels of textured carpet bases in hexagonal, linear, and understated forms invite designers to layer pattern and color atop tactile texture. <br/><br/>The PVC-free collection also boasts numerous sustainable features, including NSF 140 and CRI Green Label Plus certification for indoor air quality. The collection also carries an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and Declare Living Building Challenge Compliant label for material transparency, and contributes to LEED v4, Living Building Challenge, and other green building certifications.

As our schedules leave little time for reflection, and our digital lives remove us from our senses, we yearn for the calming power of a soft surface, the visual harmony found in nature, for physical connection. Off the Grid is a deeply textural collection, of undulating patterns that mirror the natural world, contour lines that dip and yield, boundaries that blur the edges, abstract forms, forging deeper connections to the world around us.<br/><br/>The team explored natural environments completely disconnected from their daily roles and technology. Immersing themselves in the journey and drawn, with a sense of curiosity, to details often overlooked, they found themselves marveling at micro and macro environments. From grand landscapes to delicate and intricate patterns in moss, spider webs, and trails carved by beetles, the passion for design was reignited.

Structured yet highly versatile, each pattern can stand alone or be matched with others to create dynamic looks and way-finding layouts.<br/><br/>The large and medium-scale modular patterns abstractly reference folding techniques, while a medium-scale textural tile/broadloom coordinate offers a simple, elegant base for pattern interplay. <br/><br/>Origami\u2019s 12 colorways are drawn from Antron Lumena yarns, creating a palette of solid neutrals that address cool and warm greys in light, medium and dark, as well as lovely neutral and navy blue tones. <br/><br/>Mannington\u2019s advanced tufting capabilities were used to create Origami\u2019s rich aesthetics with a 24 ounce face-weight, bringing modern luxury to any commercial space \u2014 from corporate to higher education to hospitality.<br/><br/>Origami is fully recyclable via Mannington\u2019s LOOP\u00ae program. Antron is an Environmentally Preferable Product, and Mannington\u2019s Infinity\u00ae Modular backing contains pre-consumer recycled content and is certified NSF/ANSI-140 Gold (an Environmental Product Declaration for the backing is available). <br/><br/>The collection also includes Broadloom backings Ultrabac\u00ae and Integra HP\u00ae RE, which contain a minimum of 10% post-consumer recycled content by total product weight and are Certified NSF/ANSI-140 Platinum and CRI Green Label Plus. Origami is made in the USA, in Mannington\u2019s ISO 14001 registered facilities.",

Each Terra-Grit pattern is massive, with the largest reaching a 48-foot-repeat.<br/><br/>Ideal for hospitality, Terra-Grit's huge patterns can fill large public areas like grand ballrooms and convention spaces. The designs can also have sections cut out for smaller, pre-function areas, offering a different, yet cohesive feel for the guest. Each complex design can be down to carpet an entire hotel with each area being completely unique.<br/><br/>As Brintons is the only axminster manufacturer that can weave up to 32 colors, Terra-Grit's color combinations are unexpected, seemingly pushing aside the safe color families that have become commonplace, yet still work together to create layers of dimension. Rather than simply using black to achieve depth, the Brintons team has explored each color value, combining colors from different families. A comparable process to how a painter would render shadows with Ultramarine Blue mixed with Burnt Sienna.<br/><br/>The overall theme of the collection is rooted in the need for authenticity in design: utilizing real hand-made textures and the brushstrokes of an artist's hand, celebrating a design's humble beginnings. Brintons' Global Design Team routinely practices this \"Dirty Hands\" trend movement with creative experiential workshops. The team uses an assortment of random materials and basic artist's pigments to create unusual and original textures for Brintons' carpet designs.",

As our schedules leave little time for reflection, and our digital lives remove us from our senses, we yearn for the calming power of a soft surface, the visual harmony found in nature, for physical connection. Off the Grid is a deeply textural collection, of undulating patterns that mirror the natural world, contour lines that dip and yield, boundaries that blur the edges, abstract forms, forging deeper connections to the world around us.<br/><br/>The team explored natural environments completely disconnected from their daily roles and technology. Immersing themselves in the journey and drawn, with a sense of curiosity, to details often overlooked, they found themselves marveling at micro and macro environments. From grand landscapes to delicate and intricate patterns in moss, spider webs, and trails carved by beetles, the passion for design was reignited. The designers interpreted their observations into patterns and created textures that are reminiscent of their journeys. This collection is a product of our design team\u2019s experience of reconnecting to their craft by disconnecting from their routine.<br/><br/>This collection is deeply textural and can be used to create subtle or dynamic shifts in scale and texture density. These designs evoke colors, textures and pattern from nature and brings the human touch indoors \u2013 answering the human desire for connection with nature. Off the Grid, is a product that can bring Biophilic element to our built environments. The increased need for quiet and contemplative time in the workplace is answered by this collection that draws you in and calms through its palette and ever-changing, irregular textural landscape. <br/><br/>Off The Grid is a very flexible collection. The modularity of the tiles and the multiple coordinating styles and colors offer the choice to create a variety of unique spaces. By mixing textures and patterns together, spaces can easily transition from one function or purpose to another.

This premier collection includes unique carpet tiles in a mix of 50cm squares and 25cm x 1M Skinny Planks\u2122 formats, with a range of lush-soft and crisp-delineated constructions. <br/><br/>Global Change is comprised of seven styles available in six earthy, mineral-based colorways: Eclipse, Evening Dusk, Desert Shadow, Fawn, Daylight and Morning Mist. Progression\u2122 I, Progression II and Progression III, the collection\u2019s foundational Skinny Planks, offer three gradated base textures at different pile heights. Glazing\u2122 and Shading\u2122 take inspiration from the tree canopy with foliage appearing as positive shapes against striations of texture. The texture and pattern of Progression I is incorporated into the background of the crisp foliage pattern within Shading, The same is true of Progression III, which creates that background for the more diffused organic patterning in Glazing. The result is the ability to transition from a beautifully simplistic base texture into the organic pattern of your choice in a smooth organic flow, or to mix and match to create more distinction within a space.<br/><br/>The two 50 cm square format styles featured in the collection, Ground\u2122 and Raku\u2122, round out the collection. Ground has a scaled down, tight construction like that of Glazing and Progression III but with a non-literal pattern reminiscent of branches or exposed roots. In contrast, Raku offers a plush, modeled interpretation of cracked, dried earth and can be installed as non-directional squares to create a monolithic appearance on the floor.<br/><br/>Global Change not only provides a beautiful aesthetic, but is also an environmentally-friendly product. The collection\u2019s modular design makes it easy and affordable to replace worn carpet, and the system was created to be attainable at all price points. The collection\u2019s styles are designed to harmoniously blend and coordinate with the patterned tiles, but also can be combined to play up contrasting texture and varying pile heights. The collection provides the flexibility to use one coordinating collection to respond to different needs within a space with varying looks, scales of pattern, textures and price points. Its variety makes it ideal for a range of customer environments, including corporate office, hospitality, multi-family and senior living, and education.<br/><br/>Global Change is available in all Interface markets, around the world and employs a solution-dyed Universal nylon-6,6 yarn system. It is remarkably lightweight, thereby reducing the ecological footprint of shipping. The total recycled content ranges from 26-69 percent.",

Each of these styles offer a mosaic aesthetic with Rue being the more graphic pattern featuring two tones of each bold accent color including Red, Pink, Purple, Teal, Green, Yellow, Orange and a slightly softer approach with color Grey. Stone Course offers a slight downsize in scale and the amount of color but maintaining the mosaic interpretation in the same eight color ways as Rue.<br/><br/>The collection is designed to work as a coordinating, but varied system that may be used throughout an environment and respond to the needs within the space and the way people live/work/play.

Four fresh patterns offer a range of geometric abstractions and density of line to create new planes, textures, and perspectives for the floor. The pattern variety, 18 standard colorways, and eight optional accent colors forms a kit of parts that allows designers to create custom-inspired flooring with the ease of a standard collection.<br/><br/>Maps identify location and help us to navigate the Earth\u2019s surface - a variety of regions which come to life through dynamic terrain and unique surface qualities that morph our experience. This contrast of contours creates a geological rhythm, explored in Moraine\u2019s four patterns.<br/><br/>Explorer is the geometric abstraction of the organic contour lines within a topographical map for a modern take on an ageless cartographic medium. Relief, both the antithesis and compliment to Explorer, plays with a greater line density that creates visual planes while emphasizing the geometry and rhythm of Explorer. Navigator, based on a three-dimensional point field map, uses a series of pixel points to create plane and perspective within a single tile. A combination of tiles creates a dynamic space with tilting and shifting visual planes. Lastly, Regions shifts the scale and density of Navigator for a unique surface quality.<br/><br/>Designed by the Milliken Asia Pacific Design Team, Moraine showcases the capabilities of Milliken\u2019s global design studio, regionalizing a cartography-inspired collection for the Americas. Doing so allows global companies to create and maintain interior brand standards in locations worldwide. <br/><br/>Brought to life with Milliken\u2019s proprietary Digital Dye Infusion (DDI) technology, patterns in Moraine can be completely customized without extended lead times. Each of the 12 neutral colorways can be enhanced with one of eight accents to delineate spaces, simplify wayfinding, or add a pop of color. For additional customization, overlay text or navigator symbols to deliver messages, or combine tile shapes and patterns for an even more dynamic floor.<br/><br/>The PVC-free collection features a total recycled content of 41% and boasts numerous sustainable features, including NSF 140 and CRI Green Label Plus certification for indoor air quality. The collection also carries an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and Declare Living Building Challenge Compliant label for material transparency, and contributes to LEED v4, Living Building Challenge, and other green building certifications.

Mood-setting or playful, Emergence surprises us as color and pattern appear from an elusive background. It is a rich, botanical design that takes its abstract direction from the art world to subvert realism in an aesthetically engaging form. It piques our curiosity, visually leading us through a lush landscape of tonality and pattern, with the promise that wherever we emerge, we will feel inspired.<br/><br/>This collection experiments with the perception and use of pattern in our environments. This collection is expressive, infusing the atmosphere with curiosity and delight. <br/>This collection is offered in a extra large, 36\u201dx36\u201d which allows this bold pattern to render in a dynamic way, enabling powerful visual impact. In order to create moments of respite, we explore how pattern can influence our emotions. The focus on decorative pattern, with the flexibility, practicality and performance of carpet tile, allows hospitality cues to influence the workplace \u2013 catering to silent zone, breakout, lounge/library and hospitality areas. <br/><br/>The visual impact of this pattern is highly modular: three different variations on the floral pattern can combine or be used alone to generate varying degrees impact and clarity of the pattern. Both the palette, diverse scale of pattern and tile size allow for flexible spaces and experiences. Strong colors can be tempered by cool neutrals. <br/><br/>Constructed with EcoWorx backing &amp; Eco Solution Q nylon, Emergence has superior durability, style and recyclability. The Shaw Contract lifetime commercial limited warranty covers abrasive wear, tuft-bind, edge ravel and delamination.<br/><br/>Manipulating the density of the color and texture through the pattern rendering challenged our capabilities and we adapted our existing technology to artfully present subtle color and densities of textures that then optically render these incredible florals. <br/><br/>Baroque florals, photo-real subject matter, the endless dark palette of the Dutch masters, edgy florals in menswear and a whole new consideration of our floral vocabulary unapologetically takes focus in our design interpretation. The range of color depth through subtle shifts in color density, creates a velvety backdrop for patterns to emerge. Subtle texture and a natural, tonal palette can create moments of respite. We wanted to completely relook at the opportunity for floral pattern in interior spaces, evolving from a feminine association to a play on tradition and nostalgia \u2013 using the scale which pattern can be depicted on the floor to allow this pattern to breathe and have the ability to create elegant or playful moment. We played with background and foreground to abstract and filter the shapes of the flower, creating a bold hybrid of masculine and feminine.",

The result is soft and tactile while retaining the durability for which Bolon is celebrated. Like Bolon\u2019s tile and roll flooring, Villa La Madonna rugs are designed to be flexible around the needs of its user and can be layered for dimensional effects, inviting users to play and experiment with their floors in countless configurations. Villa La Madonna is named for the boutique hotel in Piedmont, Italy belonging to Bolon\u2019s owners Annica and Marie, for which the rug collection was originally designed. The Villa La Madonna collection features a shimmery, geometric pattern and is comprised of six styles (Smoke, Moss, Golden, Graphite, Emerald and Ruby), drawing color inspiration from deep jewel tones and moody neutrals found in fashion textiles.<br/><br/>\u201cAt Bolon, we have always followed our own path and applied a fearless, inquisitive approach to developing our brand and products,\u201d says Annica Eklund, who with her sister Marie Eklund is a third-generation owner of Bolon. \u201cThe products and collaborations we\u2019re planning to unveil in 2017 are an expression of this curiosity. There have been twists and turns, but it has been in those unplanned detours that our spirit of experimentation and innovation has been released.\u201d",

This all-new edition subtly appropriates the language of black-and-white image-making to craft a meditation on modern serenity. While its mood may be contemplative, Blur\u2019s conception is an audacious challenge to the frequently tradition-bound world of hand-woven carpets. Blending the timeless poetry of Nepalese craftsmanship, the richness of materials like Tibetan wool, Chinese silk, Himalayan cashmere, and South African mohair, and effects inspired by vintage monochromatic photos, each of Blur\u2019s twelve pieces reveals an affinity between its generations-old handknotting techniques and the manual artistry of early photographers. The resulting collection paradoxically transcends its roots to put forward a stylized aesthetic of ultramodern sophistication. In designs such as Exposure and Bokeh, Blur employs photographic techniques such as the high-contrast urban lighting of film noir to reimagine the relationship between light and shadow, rendering each as a series of spectral figures confined within cropped frames. In a similar vein, designs like Aperture, Density, and Saturation pay tribute to the primitive cameras and experimental darkroom techniques of early 20th century photographers, such as Man Ray and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy.",

Alison is a San Francisco based interior designer and her designs introduces the fusion of two geometric forms that overlap to produce unconventional rug shapes, focusing on color, geometry, and the play between hard and blurry lines. This technique makes the rugs fully reversible adding usability and durability.<br/><br/>The Disc Interiors collaboration explores process and texture in a minimal and earthy way, with color palettes inspired by antique Japanese textiles. Their designs introduces the use of fringe and felted-in yarns, to create wabi-sabi linear patterns. Felting two colors in one layer, another new technique,enhances the double-sided feature of felt rugs.<br/><br/>The Raha Raissnia collaboration is based on details from two of her oil paintings. Raha is a NY based painter, experimental film maker, and performance artist. Raha's designs introduces a raw and unstructured edge which has a lower profile, perfect for both commercial and residential spaces. In the spirit of Raha\u2019s paintings and hand-made films the collection will only be offered in black and white.<br/><br/>Hinterland is a furniture manufacturer based in Vancouver, BC, led by artist/designer, builder Riley McFerrin. The Hinterland designs take a post-modern turn with Memphis-deco inspired geometric shapes floating on<br/>a pale gray field.

Two editions of Reform, a geometric rug created to be adaptable to different spaces and usages, were exhibited at Design Shanghai between 8-11 March, ICFF in New York City between May 21st to 24th and Maison et Objets in Paris between September 8th to 12th, 2017.<br/><br/>Architects Vincent Lim and Elaine Lu were inspired by everyday surroundings, and questioned why carpets had to be rectangular and static. \u201cWe wanted to create rugs that can be transformed to fit in different spaces,\u201d says Lu. \u201cReform means to make changes in order to improve something. We wanted to create a rug that would be able to conform to any space without sacrificing its inherent character. The result was the creation of a modular rug consisting of three modules that would allow users to piece together their perfect rug no matter the shape of their space.\u201d <br/><br/>Additionally, Lim + Lu looked to traditional colour wheels and overlapping circles to introduce colour into a room. \u201cColour charts of overlapping circles normally associated with visual teaching was the first inspiration for the rugs,\u201d notes Lim. \u201cWe started with overlapping circles and experimented with a range of colours, textures and patterns reminiscent of marble and precious stones.\u201d <br/><br/>Reform I illustrates how different materials can be combined, with a colour palette of pastel pinks and blues that mimic stone against metals such as brass and silver. The mixture of materials include different yarn count and pile height wool, dull silk, spun silk, flax and shiny fine lurex. Techniques such as cut and loop in different pile heights, twisted yarn, overtuft loop and sculpting\u2014a combination of hand carving, bevelling and embossing\u2014were used to achieve a medley of textures. Reform II features colour blocking with vivid hues on 100 percent wool. Both rugs were entirely handcrafted in Tai Ping\u2019s Xiamen artisan workshop.<br/><br/>\u201cWe were inspired by Tai Ping\u2019s technical capacity\u2014its craftsmanship and attention to detail were amazing,\u201d enthuses Lu. \u201cThey were very open to our ideas, and expertly carried complicated designs.\u201d Lim believes that Reform exemplifies the range of what Tai Ping can achieve through juxtaposition of materials and techniques. \u201cYou really get the rug\u2019s tactile quality with the different textures you feel under your feet,\u201d he states.",

Crafted of 100 percent wool and embellished with a variety of decorative techniques, Bandas Space brings warmth and comfort to the workplace.<br/><br/>With BANDAS, designer Patricia Urquiola brings the modular concept to its very limits. The collection started off with the creation of long and fine rugs, embroidered by craftswomen in India. Used to working in a sitting position with their work on their laps, these women were not accustomed to producing pieces wider than 60cm. But what at first seemed like a limitation eventually became an opportunity. That\u2019s how the idea for modular rugs came about: runners of different designs joined together with Velcro straps on the sides. This way, each composition is truly unique and can adapt to any layout.",

Inspired by Louise\u2019s love of Japanese aesthetics and the natural world, the eight designs in this concept collection are brought to life in hand knotted form through the luxurious combination of colour and material lustre. New Zealand wool and art silk are used together so that each design is not only delineated by colour but by the differing light reflecting properties of the materials themselves. <br/><br/>Drawing was used as a form of notation in direct response to the eight natural phenomena that inspired the designs. In the River \u2013 Kawa \u5ddd rug the abstract motif almost records the play of light on the water's surface. The process of Suminagashi \u58a8 \u6d41 \u3057 or \u201cfloating ink\u201d was explored to create the Mountain \u5c71 rug, a homage to Fuji-San. Whereas the practice of drawing Ens\u014d \u5186 \u76f8 or circles with ink inspired the Rocks \u5ca9 pattern. The making of repeated drawings led to an appreciation of the irregular forms in accordance with the concept of wabi-sabi \u4f98 \u5bc2 or the beauty of imperfection. <br/><br/>In this way, Sumi \u58a8 seeks to continue the long-established tradition in rug design of utilising symbolic motifs. A contemporary take on this practice, Louise has included non-figurative motifs throughout the collection which aims to impart something of the beauty and essence of the natural phenomena that inspired it into the interior. All the patterns in this concept collection will sit well together, as it was conceived of as a whole making them ideally suited to multi-room schemes and larger projects which require a theme.<br/><br/>All the designs in the collection are available in four carefully chosen colourways, five sizes and in New Zealand wool and art silk via Rug Couture. They are also available in hand tufted form for contract use. Louise offers a bespoke design service giving customers access to individual colour and material combinations and custom size options.",

A series of 12 new carpet concepts that reflect the visual vocabulary of his work are paired with the exquisite craftsmanship of Edward Fields artisans. The first living artist to collaborate with Edward Fields in over a decade, Mastrangelo has created dimensional expressions for the \u201cfifth wall,\u201d a term that Edward Fields himself coined in the early 20th Century. The works take a conceptual approach to rug making by transforming landscapes scouted throughout the United States into unique poetic compositions. \u201cFrom the beginning, I wanted Reverence to articulate the visual language of nature and to convey a sense of wonder and respect for our physical world - all while celebrating the endurance of form and color,\u201d Mastrangelo says. Reverence is about a record of our times. The landscape-inspired pieces crack, break, and flow to evoke a kind of realism that floats between abstraction and photography, watercolor and pastels. The palette of neutrals blends seamlessly into ombre colorations. Each fiber is meticulously planned and hand-sculpted by artisans at Edward Fields - from blended silk and wool yarns, to shag with low-pile contrasts, to surprising edging that defies right angles. The collection brings the same spirit of consideration seen in each grain of material in Mastrangelo\u2019s sculptural works.",

The design team immersed themselves in the beauty of the region, exploring the rugged coastline and trekking through mountains and forests. Their intent was not to visually recreate what they saw, but instead to capture and communicate the experience of wilderness, the spirit of exploration. Wander and wonder. Make your own path.<br/><br/>The resulting patterns harken Oregon\u2019s secluded ridge lines and trailheads, translated into luxurious textures, sharp linear movements, and layered striations of color. Two coordinating abstracts (Moraine and Timberline) play with overlays of geometries or fade in and out of focus, over an ombre wash of colors. <br/><br/>Two wood grains (Flume and Burnside) feature a unique, metallic graining finish that creates a mesmeric glimmer. The patterns span large and medium scale, and are all offered in 6\u201dx48\u201d planks. <br/><br/>The variety of styles allows for interpretation in innovative design compositions: designers can realize a unique vision for a space, whether it be a bold combination or subtle understatement. The collection\u2019s thoughtful approach to classic and emerging color trends make it an LVT perfect for corporate, retail, higher education and hospitality projects. <br/><br/>The distinctive benefits of LVT bring durability and flexibility to commercial spaces.

His unique process was developed over 40 years to seamlessly blend new and ancient wood and timber in French museums.<br/><br/>In 2015 Bertrand agreed to share his exclusive techniques with us. In the years since, his French oxidizing process has been applied to English Oak, Black Walnut, and American Oak flooring boards, creating the world's most beautiful hardwood flooring. Our master craftsmen initially began by applying the French techniques to Black Walnut with magical results! Noyer Cendr\u00e9, one of our finest pieces, was born out of that early period. The Chateau Napoleon team continued to develop the process to suit other wood species, finally achieving our goal of creating a depth of beauty in our flooring that met the world's highest standards for durability and style. <br/><br/>Since our inception, our French oxidizing and oiling techniques have captured the imagination of home owners and designers around the world and a loyal following has developed. Our French oxidized Oak flooring can be found in Mel Gibson's Malibu home (Coupe Sup\u00e9rieure collection), French oxidized reclaimed flooring has been installed in the 25 million dollar Michael S. Smith designed home of a billionaire hedge fund manager in Beverly Hills (R\u00e9clamation collection), and numerous large homes in the famed Yellowstone Club in Big Sky Montana (Cendr\u00e9 collection).

Using a broken comb to achieve a linear texture, Stewart\u2019s artwork reflected depth, shadow and highlights, all of which became an integral part of the Remove and Withdraw style and pattern.

Building upon the existing Aspecta One design portfolio, three overlay motifs \u2013 Damask, Masquerade, and Malta -- offer a wide array of options depending upon the imagination and creativity of the designer. Aspecta One Ornamental designs can be created from existing, select inventory without limitation to create unique, custom layouts within timelines and budgets.<br/><br/>Evoking ancient cultures such as Oriental, Arabic and sub-Saharan, or architecture styles like Art Nouveau or Rococo, the Aspecta One Ornamentals create a welcome contrast to the clear design language of modern architecture and interiors. These overprint styles can be layered randomly on select Aspecta One plank and tile designs or all-over for a more dramatic effect.<br/><br/>The Aspecta One Ornamental collection is ideal for such commercial settings as Hospitality, Retail, Corporate, Education and common areas of healthcare, with all the benefits that only LVT provides: stunning design and embossings, coupled with easy care and maintenance. <br/><br/>The new Aspecta One Ornamental range expresses certain principles of Biophilic Design, which evokes aspects of nature that most impact and advance occupants\u2019 health, fitness and wellbeing: a new framework for satisfying the need to experience nature in the built environment. <br/><br/>Here is a description of the aesthetic qualities of the three motifs/designs, which can be overprinted on select color tiles and woodgrain planks, and their Biophilic inspiration. <br/><br/>DAMASK: Inspired by heirloom Persian rugs handed down generation to generation, and the emerging \u201cRough Luxe\u201d distressed motif found in specialty woven carpet, Damask delivers this high-end look in affordable LVT. BIOPHILIC DESIGN INSPIRATION: Botanical motifs, Integration of Place and Culture, Attraction and Beauty. <br/><br/>MASQUERADE \u2013 Inspired by boisterous ceramic tiles, Masquerade\u2019s large medallion-like design translates well in large tile formats, combining modern concrete embossing and unicolors, which embrace each other in a refreshing, surprising way. With either a colorful or neutral base, Masquerade appears as either a positive version for a \u201cpainted\u201d impression or a negative overprint on tile that creates the hard-edge effect of carving. Its unpredictability in shape and application is refreshing. BIOPHILIC DESIGN INSPIRATION: Biomorphic Shape, Integration of Parts to Wholes, Curiosity and Enticement.<br/><br/>MALTA \u2013 This abstract, Arabesque motif complements Aspecta One 4-ft. woodgrain planks with a Moorish influence found in Southern Europe. Malta works well with vintage, Mid-Century and contemporary interiors. BIOPHILIC DESIGN INSPIRATION: Botanical motifs; Age, Change and the Patina of Time; Sensory Variability and Complementary Contrasts.<br/><br/>Aspecta One Ornamental provides a 20-year limited commercial wear warranty with Metroflor\u2019s new and improved ceramic bead finish. Its 21 Mil wear layer is topped with a Ceramic Bead finish for low maintenance and durability. On the sustainability front, the collection has received a Declare Label - a \u201cnutrition label\u201d equivalent for building products \u2013 and NSF/ANSI 332 Gold certification.",

Other series in the collection include Amalgamate, Circa, Heartwood, Public Hall, Sinker Cypress, Spalted, and Townhall. <br/>This state-of-the-art digitally printed collection combines the natural look of wood with the durability of LVT to deliver more than just a floor. Tarkett\u2019s digital print LVT yields a floor with much longer repeats \u2014 4 times longer than traditional LVT printing \u2014 and nearly endless design options.

From 10,000 feet above the earth, a variety of shapes, colors and sizes come together to make an idyllic patchwork quilt-like scene, which directly inspired Fireclay\u2019s designers. <br/><br/>The collection\u2019s eight bold patterns, ranging from linear grids to circular pivots, highlight the dynamic yet structured patchwork of fields, while its three colorways are representative of land use in the region, as well as the elements of nature that are key to agricultural production: the Warm motif pays homage to the earth and soil, the Cool motif the rain, and the White Motif the sun and sky.<br/><br/>The Agrarian collection also represents Fireclay\u2019s commitment to sustainability, environmentally friendly manufacturing processes, and the preservation of Aromas\u2019 natural beauty by using resourced local materials. <br/><br/>These large-format 8x8\u201d tiles are painted by hand with 100% lead-free glazes on a Fireclay's signature Recycled [red] clay body, which is made up of a minimum of 50% recycled products including post-consumer recycled porcelain and glass, as well as pre-consumer recycled granite dust. In addition, the brand recycles their own tile and glaze waste to be re-incorporated into their recycled clay bodies. <br/><br/>The collection's geometric designs are ideal for creating impactful focal points in residential and commercial environments alike \u2013 mix-and-match for a unique tile landscape, or choose a single pattern to create a striking feature installation. <br/><br/>The Agrarian Collection is suitable for both indoor and outdoor use in temperate climates, and for flooring as well as wall surfacing applications. However one chooses to use Agrarian, the collection\u2019s versatile patterns and color motifs offer endless possibilities for self-expression, while simultaneously telling the story of Fireclay Tile and the place that makes its story possible. <br/><br/>For more information and images, please visit: https://www.fireclaytile.com/handpainted/agrarian/.",

Designed for commercial and residential spaces, Urban District MIX can be installed on floors as well as walls, backsplashes and countertops. <br/>Mixing old with new, Urban District MIX emphasizes industrial design and explores the timeless quality of raw materials. Inspired by urban spaces found in downtown warehouse buildings, this collection offers aged, painted woods to cater to a broad range of style preferences such as rugged chic, coastal and farmhouse. <br/>With variations in size, texture and color, Urban District MIX provides designers with numerous options, allowing them the freedom to add a personal touch to their project. Included within the Urban District line, MIX is available in six modern colors based on matured, painted wood. The depth of detail in each surface combines seamlessly with organic colors. Delivering in performance, a resistant facial finish fuses to the porcelain body ensuring that this collection will stand the test of time. <br/>Wood-look tile has been popular in the industry for years, and Marazzi has focused on designing bold, stylish collections to meet this trend. Because of the versatility of this material, it is expected that demand for wood-looks will continue to increase from 2017 into 2018. This series takes a fresh approach to a classic look, showcasing the blend of rustic wood graphics with trending colors. The plank size, 4\u201d x 28\u201d, also helps designers integrate this style more seamlessly into their vision. With the demand for wood-look only increasing within the industry, the flexibility of Urban District MIX helps this collection stand apart from competitors.<br/>State-of-the-art Reveal Imaging\u00ae technology enables Marazzi to replicate the look of wood, adding in color variations and knots so it is nearly indistinguishable from authentic planks found in nature. With random variation graining and fine canyon-lines, the texture of this tile creates a warm and lavish atmosphere that designers will love.<br/>Because this collection is composed of porcelain, it delivers benefits such as resistance to frost, stains and scratches. Durable and easy to maintain, Urban District MIX offers the luxury of porcelain at a more economical cost than comparable real hardwood flooring.<br/>These properties of glazed porcelain make this series an ideal solution for designers that desire a high-end, detailed look without the stress of maintenance. Other high-performing characteristics of this series include a greater than .05% moisture absorption, less than 275 lb. breaking strength and chemical resistance.<br/>Today, this porcelain tile not only possesses the authentic look of wood, but also the organic feel of the natural material that designers will crave in their rustic projects.",

The surface of the stone has been given a variety of textures to intensify its authentic beauty. Some of the pieces have been sandblasted, lending the appearance of years of wear, while others have a linear combed texture that adds directional energy. The collection also features honed stone, which has a richer color.<br/><br/>Aupala - A set of large format modular subway tiles made from a mixture of textured stone in varying mosaic arrangements. These tiles are unique because they can be turned or stacked, and will always fit together perfectly. <br/><br/>Kardama - An elongated modular subway tile. Its scale makes it perfect for a variety of areas, including walls, floors, and backsplashes. Throughout the Kaya Collection, the surface of the stone has been given a variety of textures to intensify the authentic beauty of the natural stone.<br/><br/>Khani - The Kaya Collection was designed to create tranquil atmospheres, and the Khani mosaic embodies this intent. It is an ideal pattern to use in relaxing environments, such as around a fireplace. It uses the same geometric shape as Kardama, but on a smaller scale, and is placed in an alternating horizontal and vertical orientation. <br/><br/>Kavara\u00a0- Kavara is a modern take on a brick pattern, perfect for use in backsplashes. The gentle mix of tones in each mosaic creates a harmonious directional movement.<br/><br/>Azan - Azan is a linear mosaic that features a random blend of rectangular textured stone. While random, the mosaic has a thoughtful meditative feel. Each of the colors in Azan is made up of two textures. Both the White and Gray colorways are made up of two different grit sandblasted stones, while the Brown colorway includes honed and combed stone.<br/><br/>Labyrinths - Lastly, the collection features the Ahuta Finger Labyrinth, available in the three colorways included in the line. Running your finger along the lines of the Ahuta Labyrinth as part of your daily ritual reminds us of the importance of being thoughtful and aware. The centuries-old tradition of tracing shapes during meditation can act as a form of relaxation and prayer in your modern life. The Zama Labyrinth is a larger scale symbol, which can be inserted into a field of floor or wall tile. Looking at the Zama Labyrinth brings a sense of peace and calm.",

Its distinct features are found within the artistry of the tile, making it a truly unique product line. Over 1,500 different trees were studied in order to develop the intricate patterns and rich colors that make up the collection. The manufacturing process imitates carefully handcrafted results, reproducing all of the details of wood knots and whirls with absolute precision. This allows for the collection to express the realism of nature through each of its series.<br/><br/>The four series of the Seedwood collection are Tanzania, Vancouver, Nebraska and Minnesota. These are available in different colors and have four complementary accent wall and floor tile options: Ice, Desert, Noa, and Eden. The aim of this aesthetic versatility is that any of the collection\u2019s pieces can be combined with each other and can fit into any space.

Acoustic engineers assisted in the design challenge of reducing noise in the open office, targeting the workstation itself. Advanced sound absorbent materials were used to provide noise comfort, while a stylish retro design fits perfectly in the modern office. The 4-person workstation with an acoustic umbrella provides up to 44% improvement over standard stations with screens.<br/><br/>ThinkingQuietly Workstations seat up to six users while maintaining a polished, well-analyzed design. Wire management for worksurface clamp mount power is concealed by central infill blocks that drop wires to a cable management tray. The cable tray is constructed of acoustical material concealing power and data, while reducing floor level noise. A solid oak Y-frame creates an overhead umbrella that traps sound as it naturally travels upward. <br/><br/>Unique accessories feature contemporary desk pads made of signature noise-cancelling acoustic material with optional integrated AirCharge power. Mobile briefcases offer storage and power that can be placed between units to partition individual users without subtracting from collaboration and communication. Integrated tasklights gives each user control over lighting, and ultimately their personal work environment.<br/><br/>Beautifully finished from the top to bottom ThinkingQuietly\u2019s dynamic tables and workstations are an optimal choice for conference rooms, open offices and libraries where minimal noise is ideal. <br/><br/>ThinkingQuietly was designed by ThinkingWorks Design Studio, a design team that takes curiosity to new heights, finding solutions to design exceptional furniture. <br/><br/>\u201cAbove all, we are curious. Why curious? Because curiosity finds new ways.,\u201d says Managing Director Dean Kuch. \u201cIt strives for novel ideas and seeks out better solutions.

Designed with superior functionality and eye-catching style by Matthew Weatherly, the Kronos collection includes a new sit+stand electronic desk, a Multifunction Cabinet and a Mobile Credenza.<br/><br/>For the latest in adjustable standing desks, Kronos elevates the sit+stand desk to a level suitable for hardworking executives. Thanks to an easy-to-use digital keypad that can be mounted on either side, users can<br/>adjust the desk from 24.5 inches for sitting, and up to 49.5 inches for standing heights -- providing the perfect position for any user. This allows for comfortable sitting when intense focus is necessary, or raised to a height better suited for standing and enjoying the health benefits associated with getting on your feet. <br/><br/>Aside from its functionality, Kronos is also beautifully designed for the executive space. Featuring an ultra-smooth work surface in a soft white that is smooth, durable and easy to clean, the desktop is offset by warm, natural walnut veneers on the fascia. A modesty panel, in the same natural walnut, complements seated use and keeps wiring neatly concealed. A motorized base with a minimal satin white finish completes the design and focuses attention on the upper levels, providing a floating aesthetic.<br/><br/>With storage in mind, a unique mezzanine shelf helps the workspace stay neat and clutter-free, while an included storage drawer with a flip-down front and non-slip lining makes an ideal space for a keyboard and other office essentials. The desk also boasts a wire management ledge and channels for routing cables out of site and out of mind. A power strip can also be mounted under the desktop with the supplied mounting kit,<br/>providing one convenient location for plugging in all peripherals.<br/><br/>Complementing the Kronos sit+stand desk is a Multifunction Cabinet, designed to be the ideal height so it can be easily accessed whether sitting or standing. The cabinet rests on locking wheels and includes a supply storage drawer, an adjustable paper shelf, a gliding printer tray, and secure file storage for hanging folders.<br/><br/>The collection\u2019s Mobile Credenza provides secure storage within two storage drawers and a lateral file drawer for hanging folders. The beautifully finished console also rests on locking wheels and features adjustable shelves for storage and organization.",

Wavelike patterns of Echo flutes are formed without texture, and the sweeping curves in the pattern bring a calm sense to any environment. Using exclusive Free Forming glass procedures, Echo Glass provides a wonderful visual appeal, while also creating a light distortion and shadowing effect. These features allow for ample light transmissions without sacrificing privacy. Echo Glass will illuminate any space in reverberating fashion.<br/>Our highly motivated factory team of glass artists and technicians, produced custom molds that met the challenges of a bold and organic pattern. Forming handmade glass with a very deep, swirling pattern, is difficult enough in itself. Creating a design which flows seamlessly from panel to panel, magnifies the difficulty by about 10 fold. The creation of 5 large panels, installed side x side, where the pattern flows continuously, is a spectacular accomplishment. Adding to the extreme difficulty in formed the 5 Echo panels is the formation of flat edges on the vertical seams, which allows the panels to fit tightly together, creating the seamless vision of the swirling Echo pattern. \u201cFlat Margins\u201d, as we prefer to name them, also aid the installation crew in lining up the panels on a straight edge, providing an easy platform to inserts a small bead of silicone between the panels.<br/>The Flutes in our Echo glass pattern are perfectly clear, without texture, yet with a deep Convex shaped 3D surface. The 3-Dimensional surface creates waves which flow from panel to panel, magnifying the effect of each wave. Enjoy the way our Echo Glass playfully partitions a space, yet allows for maximum light transmission. Echo Glass also casts shadows of waves on the walls behind the panels, bringing the energy and replenishing presence of nature into the most sophisticated of modern or industrial spaces. Echo Glass panels illuminate one of the startling mysteries of physics and light\u2019s dual nature as both particle and wave. Visible from all vantage points, Echo\u2019s rippling undulations brilliantly capture, recast and reflect light.<br/>Now part of our Freeform collection, Echo Glass panels are used to create open-air privacy sound screens. These panels also define and partition rooms while enriching natural light, and creating a jewel-like feature in any space. Echo Glass is fully safety tempered, with a 5/8\u201d pattern depth, and smooth monolithic polished edges. Just as the sunlight moves through the crystal-clear ocean or lake water, these stunning decorative panels create the impression of movement in stillness, and of stillness in movement.<br/>Parallel Designs, Wavy Fluted Streams, or however one chooses to describe it, Echo Glass is sending vibes throughout the Decorative Glass community. With 3\u201d wide, deep swirling flutes formed into each glass panel, and with molds produced to create a seamless, continuous flowing pattern, from panel to panel, Echo Glass has become a popular selection for discerning interior designers and their clients.<br/>Only available at Nathan Allan!",

Meeting this expectation requires spaces to support collaboration, privacy, focus and rejuvenation. Supporting this range of needs in today\u2019s open environments is challenging and while many organizations have added areas that support collaboration, the demand for enclosed spaces tends to exceed the supply. Additionally, installing these spaces can be disruptive, time-consuming and difficult for workers and workplaces. <br/><br/>To meet the unique spatial needs we are seeing in today\u2019s workplace, Steelcase has added the IRYS pod to our North American portfolio. Developed as a collaborative effort between Clestra Hauserman and HOK Product Design, Steelcase has exclusive rights to offer this product in North America. <br/><br/>The IRYS pod is a freestanding, all-inclusive solution that makes it easy to add enclosed spaces to the open plan. It is ideal for individual focused work or small-group collaborative work and its refined aesthetic allows the pod to seamlessly blend into any existing space. <br/><br/>Each pod incorporates a ceiling, lighting, air treatment and access to power and can accommodate one to three people for either individual focused work or small-group collaborative work. Additional space under the pod\u2019s outer canopy provides a collaborative touchdown area. <br/><br/>Typical solutions for enclosed spaces require connection to the existing building structure. This is not a constraint for the IRYS pod, as it is an autonomous, self-supporting unit. Easy to order and install, the IRYS pod ships in just two weeks and requires only one day for installation, allowing spaces to be quickly transformed to meet the changing needs of today\u2019s workers.",

By graphically framing a space, FINO reveals the beauty of every interior condition while enhancing architectural features. Inspired by a minimal design aesthetic, FINO from Muraflex is a streamlined demountable wall solution, providing flexibility and convenience with less bulk. Made from fully recyclable aluminum, Muraflex offers European styling with domestic lead times. As a true demountable partition system, FINO does not require a raised floor and can be readily installed over existing flooring and accommodates multiple types of doors and low-voltage accessories. The minimalist design approach not only defines FINO visually, but strongly informs the performative aspects as well. With an emphasis on enhanced acoustical performance, FINO offers sound isolation with double acoustical seals on both hinged and sliding doors while optional drop seals further isolate sound. With a simple vocabulary of parts, alignment features, and factory pre-assembled doors, field installation and reconfiguration labor is kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>The design of FINO was to minimize the number of parts to the minimum, making installation simple and more efficient in time saving, but more importantly, decreasing the number of part lines that would otherwise detract from its graphic nature. Slim line extrusions with maximum capabilities. Custom built hardware made specifically to fit and be concealed in our profiles. <br/><br/>Glass: Available with 3/8\u201d and 1/2\u201dglass, FINO\u2019s system is engineered to go up to 10\u2019-0\u201d in height. Standard glass panel widths reach up to 4\u2019-4\u201d in both 3/8\u201d and 1/2\u201d glass.<br/><br/>FINO was designed with a sophisticated aesthetic in mind. Its slender profile measuring 2-3/8\u201dH x 1\u201dW welcomes carefully-conceived, transparent gaskets in order to achieve the best STC ratings. <br/><br/>FINO is able to respond to a wide range of acoustic requirements, from STC 36 to STC 42, depending on wall configuration.<br/><br/>Muraflex is a GREENGUARD and GREENGUARD GOLD certified company. FINO frames are made from fully recyclable aluminum as well as Muraflex\u2019s proximity makes FINO a more sustainable option for your project. All attributed credits and LEED points have been pre-calculated and all supporting documentation is available upon request.<br/><br/>Because time is always of the essence during the installation phase of every project, Muraflex developed a packaging and ship-ping system that makes the unloading and placing of extrusions easier as each elevation is packaged separately and identified with the room and elevation number it belongs to. Our glass is also identified in the same way with a tag identifying the room and elevation number. In addition, Muraflex performs any machining necessary in the factory and prefabricates FINO\u2019s framed pivot doors prior to shipping, therefore eliminating any floor assembly from being done in the field, reducing the installation time for FINO to approximately 1 hour per linear foot. To further facilitate its installation, FINO frames allow for total traveling of 1-1/4\u201d. FINO is designed to be installed on bulkhead ceiling in order to offer the best acoustical performance.",

With a unique beam framework and robust accessories program, the Expansion Cityline furniture system creates workstations, collaborative spaces and mixed-use areas in which people can feel comfortable and empowered as they pursue individual and collective goals. Expansion Cityline offers a highly active setting that allows people to move, to gather and to disperse when privacy and focus is desired. <br/><br/>It provides the unique ability to go from a full, freestanding workstation to a simple, casual, beam, fence-like application integrating gathering areas. Its breadth of offering delivers a wide range of flexibility for designing office spaces, from playful to elegant and sophisticated environments. The unique flexibility of the structure enables Expansion Cityline to be designed around the building architecture and blend with its environment.<br/><br/>Expansion Cityline is a true connection between workstations and casual spaces. The beam acts as a highway, linking different zones of social interaction, fostering exchanges and collaboration. The structural beam remains the backbone, providing unlimited configurations. It can be dressed up or down as needed. Within the same area the beam seamlessly links standing-height workspaces, casual lounge seating and task-chair activity. Expansion Cityline can be configured as a distribution fence for power and data, and is ideal for reconfigurable working spaces or collaborative areas. Expansion Cityline adapts to a space and its required functions.<br/><br/>As structure, Expansion Cityline\u2019s beam permits 90-degree planning in multiple directions and supports a wide variety of configurations, including double and single-sided formats or acting as a simple, power-enabled fence that allows for direct plug-in to the beam. Height-adjustable worksurfaces are easily accommodated. Electricity/data flow through the beam along any path, accessible directly or via a power access door, power module and grommets. The beam provides all the advantages of a panel \u2013 without the panel. <br/><br/>A comprehensive program of accessories and screens enables people to work efficiently and effectively, while also contributing to \u201cplace-making\u201d and a distinct work culture. Accessories include elevated and mounted screens with a choice of surfaces \u2013 felt, whiteboard and magnetic metal \u2013 to meet personal needs and preferences. Sit and Slide screens allow control of visual privacy. Expansion Cityline also offers storage trays, modular drawers, elevated shelf with accessories and a range of additional tools designed to adapt workspace to specific tasks and maintain easy access to task lighting, mobile devices, mini-whiteboards and other personal items. <br/><br/>From the outset, Expansion Cityline was designed with fully integrated height adjustability and is not, therefore, an \u201cadd-on.\u201d From layering, suspended storage to floor-length screens, Expansion Cityline hits several different aesthetic levels. Special attention has been given to offering a wide range of materials, finishes and functionality. Multiple combinations of aesthetics and functionality provide scalability in price.",

As office dynamics undergo a major transformation with new work styles emerging and new generations entering the workforce, traditional office spaces and aesthetics no longer serve the needs of the modern office. Zones Enhancements are meant to revolutionize traditional workstation environments with forms, shapes and materials usually associated with residential/hospitality spaces. By introducing these familiar markers of home, companies can enhance productivity, motivation and fulfillment of employees. <br/><br/>New Zones freestanding screens, soft seating, casual tables and lighting allow users to create more casual settings using their own combination of Zones components. Further additions to the accessories offering such as Tech Easels, Coatcheck easels, collaborative storage and food trolleys allow users to further enhance the workshop settings to promote productivity. New soft seating enables a variety of new setting possibilities, and new tables, worksurfaces, supports and desk-edge screens integrate seamlessly with existing Teknion systems products \u2013 District and upStage. These enhancements dramatically change the aesthetic appeal and feel of existing and new spaces by adding warm, soft, residential elements to the workspace. <br/><br/>Zones Enhancements allow it to be used in a variety of new applications and settings. Each setting provides a variety of needed functionality ranging from a focus lounge area to a more dynamic workshop area. In addition, a variety of settings can be created with the furniture components that comprise the Zones enhancement collection. For example, bar-height Zones canteen tables integrate with Teknion\u2019s District or upStage furniture products to create reconfigurable sit-stand working areas within workstations. Screens, sofas, casual tables and lighting create a variety of casual or formal lounge settings. Accessories and easels create functional activity within the workshop settings. <br/><br/>Zones accessories are freestanding and mobile, allowing them to be easily rearranged throughout the office as needs evolve. They can be grouped together or used separately to support a variety of spaces. Screens are offered in two heights to provide varied levels of privacy in lounge or workshop settings. Tables are freestanding and can be easily repositioned to create various working areas based on changing tasks and needs. <br/><br/>Zones Enhancements combine laminated wood, solid wood, aluminum and steel to achieve BIFMA and other certification requirements to ensure that, while Zones products deliver a residential aesthetic, they are ready for the daily real-world use of contract furniture. Soft linear forms represented by the Zones wooden leg, curvature of the wooden and fabric screens, and soft corners of worksurfaces add sophisticated, homey, craft-like quality to existing systems components. <br/><br/>Zones Enhancements show that function does not need to be sacrificed to achieve aesthetics. Clients looking for contemporary, residential finishes and design solutions no longer need to forgo the durability and robust functionality of contract furniture. One or all elements can be integrated into the systems product, maintaining existing specifications while enhancing the product with visually appealing characteristics that dramatically change the look and feel of the space.",

Narrate was thoughtfully designed and developed to allow designers to effortlessly create custom work areas and tailor configurations for clients with design in mind.<br/><br/>The Narrate collection inspires designers and end-users to have a completely different visual respect for the panel system. While panel systems serve a variety of functions, and are still very popular in today\u2019s work environments, they are usually very similar in style and offer little in the terms of design appeal. Narrate changes all of that.<br/><br/>Narrate, which epitomizes the future of adaptable design, has a crisp, clean aesthetic and provides designers a flexible open plan furniture offering. With a more relevant approach to the traditional panel system, one of the collection\u2019s key features is the ability to customize end panels. Narrate is designed to be an integral component to the open workstation design layout, using end panels to make a statement, insert a variety of materials, or punctuate specific work zones. Narrate\u2019s end panel system can be outfitted with customized graphics, mixed materials, layered panels, seamed panels and more. The collection also allows designers to incorporate \u2018shelters,\u2019 creating visual interest, acoustical separation or to encourage private thinking areas. The Narrate collection integrates other iconic Kimball collections including the Traxx collection.<br/><br/>Additional Key Features of the Narrate Collection:<br/>\u2022\tKimball's Traxx system can be used with Narrate to allow infinite placement of thin horizontal support brackets for off-module placement of furniture, which is extremely important in the open plan. <br/>\u2022\tStackable frames and transition posts allow the panel height to be changed without having to dismantle the system for ease of re-configurability. <br/>\u2022\tOne- and two-high stackable frames can span multiple panels allowing glass tiles to extend over multiple frames, resulting in a new perspective of the traditional panel system.<br/>\u2022\tOption to embed a monitor behind back-painted glass tile for a clean, functional aesthetic.<br/>\u2022\tIncorporate static or height adjustable desks with stationary or mobile storage.<br/>\u2022\tTechnology is conveniently and efficiently integrated throughout the entire collection. <br/>\u2022\tFull tiles to the floor (with electrical capabilities on inside) are also a viable option.<br/><br/>Narrate instinctively combines design, technology and flexibility to support a dynamic workplace environment and let's your brand story unfold visually through the expressive, flexible design system.",

The patented Easy Handle connection technology is the key: the mechanism clicks into the table top, handles fix the locks \u2013 for absolute <br/>security and stability. A well-thought-out optimum of weight, span width and cost effectiveness. Positioning pins guarantee the precise connection of the table tops. <br/><br/>The textile cable mesh and cable duct are simple to assemble flexibly using clips.

Intro combines beautiful form and practical functionality to create an intelligent table system for both flexible and fixed arrangements. Intro is a conference table for the 21st century. As people continue to grow, change, and adapt to the technology around us, so too should the environments we work in. Intro is designed for conference, meetings and seminars\u2014 in short, for all a company\u2019s communications needs.<br/>Intro is not your typical conference table. Designed to be easy to operate, Intro tables can be configured into many different sizes and shapes. Intro\u2019s clean and elegant legs are the foundation for a beautiful design. Configurations are built by connecting table tops with a removable leg. Configurations are easy to assemble, disassemble, and reassemble without the use of tools. Two levers discreetly lock the legs to the tabletop. Intro has multiple connection points so the leg can act as a connecting element or as an end leg. This feature creates a freedom in design where one unit can serve more than one function, depending on what is needed per the current configuration. The advantages are clear: greater flexibility and efficient use of space.<br/>Aluminum legs are chrome plated or powder coated in Davis\u2019 standard line, now with more options than ever before. Not only a hallmark of the distinctive design, the legs also serve as an integral design feature for table security. Legs act as the connecting element between tables to guarantee stability and the placement ensures maximum legroom.<br/>The Intro table program includes tops available in veneer and high performance \u201cSoft-Touch\u201d Fenix laminate. Fenix laminate is a durable and fixable solution that has a graceful smooth touch. The tops are also available in standard Davis veneers. The knife edge detail heightens the design illusion, making the tops looks incredibly sleek and thin, all while maintaining their structural integrity.",

Combining the elements of fitness and furniture, interior designer Glory Tam &amp; home doctor Albert Au from Hong Kong designed the Habit Furniture series in order to encourage people to workout at any moments they want in the comforts of their own homes. <br/><br/>Recently, this product is live on Kickstarter as a crowdfunding project from 28 August to 12 October, 2017. Through crowdfunding, we hope to share our creativity with the whole world and get ready to launch more fitness furniture in the future.<br/><br/>TheHabit bench is a multifunctional furniture which can be served as a coffee table or a fitness bench. People can workout whenever and wherever they want by just flipping the bench at home. The modern polygonal design and natural colour scheme make it more compatible with different home styles. On the v-side of the bench, a charcoal grey vinyl elastic cushion is installed for the workout purpose. It is easy-cleaned and perfect for workout. <br/><br/>TheHabit bench is made of plywood, arranged in a direction perpendicular to each other with walnut veneer cover. We chose to use plywood not only because it retains the texture of the natural wood, but also of its high strength, which is effectively resistant to deformation. The plywood-made bench is also light in itself -- it weighs only about 25kg so you need not worry if it is too cumbersome to flip. At the same time, in order to ensure theHabit bench can safely support the user during workout, stronger plywood with higher density -- blockboard is used.<br/><br/>Dimensions of the bench: W135cm x D35cm x H45cm",

Designed by Joe Doyle for John Hutton\u2122, the chairs are a sophisticated, luxurious take on the classic Adirondack design of the Northeast, putting them in a class all their own. With grand, regal features and a commodious yet sleek design, this collection truly makes a bold statement in terms of presence and scale.<br/><br/>Inspired by the Great Camps of the Adirondack Mountains, Sutherland's Great Camp collection embodies the 19th Century notion of \"roughing it\" in the wilderness while surrounded by luxury. The collection combines the rustic, Americana feel of the original Adirondack chair with the high-end, modern design style and quality of Sutherland craftsmanship.<br/><br/>These are not your typical Adirondack chairs. There are hundreds of variations of this outdoor staple, but the chairs Sutherland has created for the Great Camp collection truly set themselves above the rest in terms of design refinement. They are slick and distinguished with a simple execution, and their volume and scale gives them a grand presence as well as an inviting, all-enveloping sense of comfort. They perfectly emulate the high-end feel, classic architecture and mountain charm of the Great Camps.<br/><br/>The chair highlights the remarkable outdoor performance characteristics Sutherland Furniture\u00ae is known for. The chairs merge the ideas of style and comfort together, featuring wide, straight arms, an ample and inviting depth and a back-to-seat pitch angle ideal for lounging and relaxing in the great outdoors. The new collection is offered in both teak wood and powder-coated aluminum frames in 20 different colors designed to add a specific distinction to any outdoor design aesthetic or atmosphere.<br/><br/>The Great Camp Chair can go where the original wouldn't dare. Sutherland and Joe Doyle wanted this chair to be both laid back and stately, and a permanent fixture in the landscape. They put curves only where anatomy demanded, all else is clean and straight. They also made the pitch more erect and borrowed the tall narrow back from an old favorite, Thomas Lee's Westport Chair. \u201cThe result, we think, is an Adirondack Chair after finishing school.\" \u2013 Joe Doyle",

Neither one inspired the name of this collection, but we regress and present to you this series of commercial tables and chairs that embody organic simplicity. This series of indoor and outdoor furniture with a curvaceous signature shape has interplay of concavity and convexity, bringing optimal comfort and a revitalizing pop of color to any space. We have upped the style quotient by having a single tone version or adding a secondary color to the front. Technically speaking, GOBY is made of one-piece, rotationally molded, specially formulated, high-impact polyethylene with ultraviolet light stabilizers (to reduce fading). The commercial-grade polyethylene material is also FDA-approved, making it ideal for restaurants, food courts and entertainment facilities. It\u2019s also chemically resistant to bleach, salt solution and chlorine solution and its Premium TruColor\u2122 material is fully compounded for superior color and quality assurance. RIPTIDE has enhanced UV resistant formulation suitable for both indoor and outdoor use and is equipped with corrosion-resistant adjustable floor glides. It\u2019s also GREENGUARD and GREENGUARD Gold Certified by UL Environment and is certified for low chemical emissions to UL 2818. UL.COM/GG. This series is part of the inaugural collection from TONIK, a new hospitality furniture brand wrapped around a full blown design statement that pushes beyond boundaries and transforms everyday spaces into funky slices of paradise that connect people. We\u2019re also a designer collective and work with the best and brightest minds, including the uber-cool, industrial design-guru Karim Rashid. Tonik embodies the American spirit: we come from different backgrounds, we relish deep discussions of differing opinions that bring us closer together, we work hard with a can-do attitude, and we care about being good stewards to our next generations. And we do it in comfort and style. So take a trip. Take a dip. Take a sip. The world is a lot more interesting with a splash of TONIK.",

The end result is an incredible integration of tones,<br/>textures and patterns, traditionally found in indoor products, designed to be used<br/>out in the open.<br/>On sand, or lawns, carpeting over a deck or just bringing an element of comfort to<br/>low benches, GARDEN LAYERS adds an extra touch of well-being and refinement to<br/>life outdoors, inspired by the long eastern tradition of lounging in open air spaces.<br/>The collection can be used for relaxation or sun bathing beside a pool, at the beach<br/>or on any surface near water. Also perfect to use under a shade, GARDEN LAYERS<br/>is a space of relaxation, of conversation in porches or under pergolas, given its<br/>adaptability to warm environments as well as other more moderate climates.

The freedom to move, to enjoy independence or intimate moments - to be at one, whether alone or with those closest to you. But atmosphere also buzzes with chatter and laughter and dancing light - the sound of good times amongst family and friends.<br/><br/>For the new Gloster Atmosphere collection, Danish designer Cecilie Manz has drawn from observing couples, groups, friends and families interacting in seating areas - sliding down low in comfortable furniture, tucking up legs, resting side by side as stories are told and moments are shared.<br/><br/>\u201cThis is why it felt natural\u201d Cecilie says, \u201cto lower the whole setting, to enhance and welcome this feeling of comfort and quiet - when you wish to have slightly more relaxed moments, even a few centimetres in height makes a signi\ufb01cant difference. Sitting lower pulls you into a familiar, soothing embrace - welcoming you to unwind and stay longer.\u201d<br/><br/>Cecilie has intuitively embraced the emotions behind the design in a powerful mixture of minimal, powder coated aluminium frames, generous boards of Gloster\u2019s signature teak and cleverly designed self-supporting upholstered panels.<br/><br/>The minimal aluminium frames are \ufb01nished with a resilient powder coating in Fossil colour and the self-supporting upholstered panels are covered with a selection of weather resistant outdoor fabrics by Sunbrella. Accompanying seat pads are also available in a variety of matching, muted colours.<br/><br/>The collection itself is comprised of a series of dining and seating components that share slim lines and welcoming, curved upholstered arms and backs. Equally attractive as stand-alone items or in a collection, the signature daybed/chaise lounge units are accompanied by an imposing sofa and occasional tables that easily double as ottomans or impromptu benches with the use of an upholstered pad.<br/><br/>Cecilie says \u201cThe materials in a project should re\ufb02ect the usage of the pieces. Aluminium and teak are great materials for outdoor spaces, the \ufb01nish of the metal is robust, and the solid teak gets a beautiful grey patina over time.

The collection is named for its clean lines and seamless connectivity of premium teak wood.<br/> <br/>Inspired by the organic modernist styles of architect and designer Alvar Aalto and furniture designer Gerald Summers, the collection is driven by the principles of simplicity and nature, as well as the rigors of form and function. This dynamic combination is what guides each piece in the collection. Every component is vital and works in harmony \u2013 nothing can be added, nothing can be taken away.<br/> <br/>Alvar Aalto's Paimio Chair and Gerald Summers' infamous 1935 Bent Plywood Armchair were revolutionary due to the use of laminated plywood. Mindel notes that the success of Aalto and Summers' work originated from exploring the possibilities of this new material and exploiting its inherent ability to be molded and bent into organic forms without resorting to the use of surface ornamentation.<br/> <br/>The challenge posed in the creation of outdoor furniture is that the most suitable and sustainable materials, teak and mahogany, cannot employ the form-making techniques of bent plywood. Computer Numerical Control (CNC) technology enables the cutting of the teak in organic curved slices that are held together through threaded steel bars. Through this technique the chair transcends the material and, without applied ornamentation, finds an inevitable form, function and beauty that is inspired by the rigor and honesty of Aalto and Summers' design philosophy.<br/> <br/>The pieces in the Continuous Line collection follow this same design concept and distinctive minimalistic aesthetic. The lounge chair is enhanced by 316 stainless steel joinery, which is not only critical to its function but also augments its graceful, lithe design. The lounge chair was inspired by Gerald Summers' Bent Plywood Armchair, which Mindel describes as \"seemingly derived from a single plane of wood and cut and manipulated into a chair like origami.\" The chair echoes this principle with fluid, parallel lines of teak wood that flow and connect seamlessly to form the chair's iconic silhouette.<br/> <br/>The chair features wide arms, a comfortable pitch angle and a bit of movement. It is offered in both natural and weathered teak wood finishes.",

With its material mix of teak, textiles and woven fiber for the seats, the collection conveys an exceptionally rich and luxurious feel.<br/><br/>The TIBBO chairs are distinguished by round arms and legs and the sail- like three-dimensional curve of its thin, formed seat back. \u201cThe beauty of turned wooden has a tactile quality like no other material,\u201d the designers explain. \u201cBecause of the oily nature of teak, the wood feels especially soft, and so we set out make furniture that would accentuate these properties.\u201d<br/><br/>Overall, the collection conveys a sense of architectural rigor in its both its construction and its proportions. A spectacular 3.5 meters in length, the largest of the dining tables stands on just four legs, accommodating 10 diners with ease. But the rationality of TIBBO\u2019s design is balanced by the warmth of the wood, the comfort of the cushions and the soft touch and natural look of the fiber, specially developed for the collection.<br/><br/>TIBBO is hand-crafted from slow-growth premium teak sourced from sustainable plantations. Premium teak offers great weather-resistance and durability even in extreme conditions. Consisting of a dining chair, four sizes of dining table, two sizes of bench, a lounge chair, a coffee table and a side table, the collection is equally at home outdoors, where it will naturally acquire a silver-grey patina, or indoors, where it will retain its golden hue.<br/><br/>The TIBBO collection represents DEDON\u2019s first collaboration with the award-winning designers Jay Osgerby and Edward Barber. Since founding their London studio in 1996, the partners have won worldwide acclaim for their industrial design, furniture, lighting, site-specific installations and public commissions, including the London 2012 Olympic Torch.

With a contemporary aesthetic, this asymmetrical block stripe is ideal for a modern home or commercial setting. Avenues is 54\u201d wide and available in colors Daylight (neutral tones white, flax and gravel) and Midnight (darker tones black, blue and charcoal).<br/><br/>Named for the thin, wispy cloud formation, Cirrus portrays an allover cloud look. Multiple weaves give this fabric the illusion of layering or clouds floating. Suited for both traditional shade applications and more unique cabanas and other shade structures, Cirrus is 54\u201d wide and available in colors Dove (cool gray tone) and Sand (warm linen tone).<br/><br/>Avenues and Cirrus utilize a traditional fabric construction, ideal for upscale, highly decorative applications.

Pure quartzite and architectural bronze with a subtle aluminum substrate are the only materials used.<br/><br/>Design brief <br/>A favorite client was looking for a dining table to replace the one they had since they were first married. They needed something durable and flexible that would allow a few extra chairs to be easily squeezed around for larger family gatherings. They also wanted something edgy; as art collectors and consultants, their home is a mix of elegant and provocative, and this table, needed to strike that balance.<br/><br/>The result is Aaron. Strong, elegant, edgy and timeless, using pure quartzite and architectural bronze with a subtle aluminum substrate as his only materials. His pedestal legs butterfly at a shallow 140-degree angle to triangulate his stance firmly with a minimal footprint and no wobble. A felted-underside of each base protects the wood floors. A hollow 4\" x 1 1/4\" structural centre spine runs the length of the table ending in a 10 degree chamfer which is capped and filled<br/><br/>Each leg is narrowest at knee-height offering maximum squeezing-in space, and lighter weight. The pedestals then flare-out wide at the top to meet the edge of the table at an impossible 10-degree angle; shallow enough to ensure knees don't touch it. The tight angle demands an impressive 10-degree chamfer to the 3/4\" thick top edge of the stone, polished to a paper-thin 3/8\" radius edge. Natural Quartzite is hard enough and stable enough to achieve this fine edge with a 100% pure natural material top.<br/><br/>The legs and top are intimately integrated with the 1/4\" thick bronze leg appearing to slice through the stone edge and completing itself in a V on the surface, flush with the polished stone. The bronze line is inlaid into the continuous stone slab.<br/><br/>Key features<br/>The Aaron dining table was designed with materials that provide a striking contrast each other. The cool rigid grey of the stone is softened by the warm glow of the bronze metal. The inlaid bronze gleams on the surface of the table.<br/><br/>There is a great strength in the materials used for this table. The stone and bronze are extremely durable with a lifespan that allows the table to stay in the family for many generations.<br/><br/>The shape of the table base is practical and convenient as it allows many people to sit around the table with almost no leg interference. The Aaron table is beautiful and practical dining table to gather your family and friends around.<br/><br/>Specialist artisan skills <br/>The quartzite stone selected for the table top is an incredibly hard material. The craftsmen who worked on the stone had to leave the CNC cutter on overnight to cut get through the hard surface. Achieving a 3/8\u201d radius on the stone edge could only have been done using great skill.",

Material is sourced in the USA and it is of the highest optical clarity. There is simply nothing like this chess table in the world.<br/><br/>This full size 23\u201d x 23\u201d tournament chess board and pieces seemingly float on a frame of fine acrylic that has been peerlessly cut, glued and buffered by our expert team of NYC artisans. The entire table has the strength and solidarity of strong hard wood and yet the optical clarity of ice. <br/><br/>The tempered glass chess board with individually hand-crafted acrylic pieces is perfectly centered on a comfortable table and rests between two glistening tempered glass plates. The transparency and precision is so precise that you\u2019ll believe the board itself is floating mid-air. <br/><br/>When you enter the room your vision will immediately be drawn to the boldly printed ebony checkered chess board and its stunning ebony chess pieces that face off against their ultimate adversaries, the clear-as-ice chess pieces. The ongoing ebony versus ice rivalry is staged in a calm, cool Islandic setting. <br/><br/>Underneath the \u00bc\u201d thick glass chess board is a white sub-board of the exact same dimension that can be easily interchanged with clear glass depending on personal preference. <br/><br/>Each lustrous chess piece, from the humble pawn to the magnificent King, has been hand-cut and polished to perfection. At Plexi-Craft, everything touched by our artisans is worked to precision using the care of an old world watchmaker. That personal embrace of the material is why our craftsmen loved working on this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Lastly, the chess board can be easily lifted out and swapped with a solid white leather insert so the entire top is flush and the table can be utilized as a gorgeous clear console with leather wrap center. <br/><br/>Given its transparency the game table is a compliment to any living room decor. It can be tucked into a quiet nook for the most serious match, or it can be a stunning centerpiece display so all may appreciate its visual beauty. No matter if you are grandmaster or a beginner, this is the game table you have been waiting for. <br/><br/>Plexi-Craft is unique among custom acrylic furniture manufacturers having been located in NYC since the 1960\u2019s. Over the years Plexi-Craft has become synonymous with precision, reliability and stretching creative boundaries. At any point in time our design team is collaborating with award-winning architects and interior designers to satisfy their equally accomplished and discriminating clientele. We\u2019re as demanding on ourselves as your clients are with you. At Plexi-Craft every design becomes a masterpiece.",

It features sheets of glass with micro-layers of metal oxide that refract light into multiple hues. At 13\"L x 13\"W x 18.5\"H, it is extremely structural and minimal in profile, working beautifully as a side table in any interior. \"I have worked for more than 20 years with dichroic glass,\" says Rottet. Driven by the goal to create a table that looks different from every angle, the Dichroic Table explores the relationship between lighting, color, location and reflection. It is a signature piece for its simplicity and dynamic beauty.<br/> <br/>The frame of the table is stainless steel, but it can also come in bronze. The dichroic glass itself is composed of laminated glass with a layer of clear and a layer of dichroic glass. Glass to metal connections utilize newer technology machines that secure the hold better than before. The optic nature of the dichroic glass is a result of\u00a0multiple ultra-thin layers of different metals (such as gold or silver); oxides of such metals as titanium, chromium, aluminum, zirconium, magnesium or silica which are vaporized\u00a0by an electron beam in an advanced vacuum chamber. The vapor then condenses on the surface of the glass in the form of a crystal structure, which is as durable as the glass surface and fully integrated.",

Reform, which specialises in customising IKEA's Metod and Sektion kitchen cupboards, enlisted the two Stockholm-based studios to create sideboards in hopes of making design-led fittings more affordable. Note Design Studio and Afteroom are two of the biggest Scandinavian designers at the moment and their design philosophy is very much like Reforms. Note Design Studio and Afteroom join a list of studios that have collaborated with Reform to create hacked IKEA furniture. Reform usually focuses on kitchens, but its latest project expands the brand's remit to the living room.<br/><br/>Afteroom, founded by Hung-Ming Chen and Chen-Yen Wei, aimed to create a piece of furniture that would stand the test of time. They used a \"classic\" colour palette of powder blue, off-white, pink blush and black. Doors are textured with shallow grooves, which looks similar to corrugated metal sheeting. Dominating Afteroom's sideboard is the straight lines that are a fundamental element of classical interior design, and the graceful and elegant lines on the sideboard allow it to be easily integrated into any room and simply matched with other furniture for a look that is clean and uncluttered.<br/><br/>Note Design Studio aimed to create a decadent yet contemporary piece through the use of terrazzo and wood. While one cabinet takes its cues from 1970s furniture \u2013 combining brown-coloured materials \u2013 a second is all-white and offers a contemporary-looking alternative. Note's sideboard plays with the contrast between contemporary design and traditional elegance. It's a sculptural piece through colour, material, silhouette, and its mix of simplicity and indulgent materials.",

We're as proud of our midcentury roots as we are our commitment to handcrafting furniture, which is why we introduced a collection with modern flair that highlights craftsmanship and our expanded casegood capabilities, and also serves as inspiration for our trade clientele. We wanted it to feel relevant &amp; fresh, hence Cuba. Our 2017 spring/summer capsule collection, La Habana, is comprised of seven pieces: a smoking chair, smoking table, room screen, love seat, bar cabinet, humidor &amp; tufted ottoman.

It can also be the vitrine where objects of daily use can be organized: the wine glasses and bottles in the dining room, a selection of books in the office, or cosmetic products in a bathroom. <br/>Soulbox does not need a material content to justify its raison d'etre. It can be empty and still fill the room with the color of its materials, the reflections and the light it shines. <br/>Soulbox has a simple and functional design. The visual effect of the acrylic glass plates of different colors is highlighted by the installation of LED strips in its back, and by the use of iridescent vinyl.<br/><br/>SOULBOX has been exhibited in Zona MACO Art Fair, CDMX, Mexico (February 2017) and in Producto Fresco \u2013 Fresh Product, Madrid, Spain (June 2017).",

It highlights the strength and raw beauty of natural materials as exposed to the elements overtime with blackened steel, hand-charred woods and textured basalt stones and combines those natural pieces with modern black delrin and glass. <br/><br/>In bringing the collection to life, Desiron leveraged the skills and abilities of the artisans at its 30,000 square foot New Jersey factory experimenting with the ancient Japanese art of Shou Sugi Ban to create blackened wood while also developing a raw, gradient metal finish called \u201coil quenched steel\u201d that creates an amber in both color and texture. <br/><br/>\u201cIn designing this collection, we were particularly inspired by the use of materials and how they tell the story of the artisans who manipulate them,\u201d said Matt Berman, Co-Founder and Principal of Workshop/APD. \u201cWe were drawn to the idea of the craftsperson and chose to use textured stones, metals that show a natural patina and wood that was charred by hand using Desiron\u2019s expert techniques.\u201d <br/><br/>One of the standouts in this five-piece collection is the Bar Cart, designed to stand alone or serve as an accent piece in a residential living space. Each piece in this collection has a thin elegance in its line - like a drawing. Whether used for storing liquor, decanters, barware, or even used as a decorative piece to house candles, blankets, or other unconventional items for a bar cart \u2013 its sophisticated, sleek lines and rugged finishes, which are entirely customizable, lend an artistic point of view to interiors.",

A technological exploration of shadow and highlights, layers of pixelated color blocks create pseudo-random patterns for familiar yet novel structure, while digitally encoded texture lends elevated dimensionality. <br/><br/>Encryption fulfills the stringent requirements of the newest LEED v4 credit addressing material traceability and transparency: LEED v4 MRc4 Building Product Disclosure and Optimization - Material Ingredients credit (Option 3). The next tier of material transparency, this credit dives into the chemical makeup of supplier materials for an elevated understanding of their resulting human and environmental health impacts. Milliken is the first flooring manufacturer that can contribute to this credit. <br/><br/>The new LEED v4 credit is designed to reward manufacturers who optimize supplier material chemistry. The rigorous process includes:<br/><br/>\u2022 Formalizing a plan to optimize supplier chemistry,<br/>\u2022 Understanding what is in 99 percent by mass of all chemical ingredients in a supplier\u2019s product, such as nylon yarn,<br/>\u2022 Understanding the chemical composition and potential associated hazards in a supplier\u2019s product, <br/>\u2022 Notifying suppliers if hazardous ingredients are found in formulations, per Table 1 GHS Hazard Criteria for Endpoint for Option 3 Screening, and<br/>\u2022 Confirming that manufacturers and suppliers had the appropriate environment and health and safety systems in place to cover potentially hazards ingredients.<br/><br/>This transparency level is revolutionary in the marketplace, but essential to fully understand the true health impact of materials. <br/><br/>The result of Milliken\u2019s unparalleled design, research and development capabilities to solve some of the most pressing issues of interior flooring, Encryption merges a sustainable, performance-driven construction with innovative design.<br/><br/>To minimize raw materials without compromising performance, Encryption features 39.3% total recycled content. A proprietary moisture vapor-wicking cushion backing extends its usable life up to 40% more than other carpets and eliminates conditions in which mold and mildew grow. <br/><br/>The PVC-free construction also prioritizes occupant well-being. An optional TractionBack\u00ae bio-based, adhesive-free installation technology improves indoor air quality by reducing or eliminating volatile organic compound off-gassing. There is also no waste, such as peel/stick backings.<br/><br/>For environmental and material health impacts, Encryption carries a third-party verified Environmental Product Declaration and third-party verified Red List Compliant Declare Label to provide transparency for any ingredient that constitutes 0.01% of the carpet. Milliken believes in intelligent sourcing, and this deep understanding extends to the materials our suppliers use to create products, from yarn to recycled content. Encryption is also made with up to 52% renewable energy through Milliken-owned hydroelectric energy generation. <br/><br/>Zero process waste from the manufacturing of Encryption is sent to landfill \u2013 an achievement of Milliken\u2019s for a quarter of a century. With Milliken\u2019s Landfill Diversion Program, the company reclaims used carpet and identifies the eco-friendliest form of diversion. <br/><br/>Available in 25 cm x 1 m modular carpet tiles.",

            "description_html": "\u201cLess is more\u201d has long been a minimalist design principle, and it\u2019s one that Rocky Mountain Hardware has recently put into practice, creating a collection of door sets reflective of the aesthetic. \u201cEdge\u201d is the new arrival, distinguished by an escutcheon that measures 2 inches wide vs. the standard 2.5-inch. This slimmer, narrower style adds a more contemporary choice to Rocky Mountain\u2019s swelling portfolio of products, and answers the call from architect and interior designer clients for hardware that has a smaller dimension . With the launch of \u201cEdge\u201d also come two new textured finishes exclusive to the series: Wire is a tactile as well as visual tease, with a tangle of lines enwrapping the surface; and Moonscape has a fluidity that\u2019s frozen in place, created by a bronze over pour in production and resulting in an intriguing motif. In addition to these edgier treatments, \u201cEdge\u201d is offered in four other texture options that have long been in Rocky Mountain\u2019s lineup along with a choice of 10 high quality finishes that are signatures of the brand\u2019s art-bronze construction. Ideal for residential as well as commercial projects, the \u201cEdge\u201d group includes a complete offering of all door hardware functions\u2014from entry to interior and even sliding. From the company\u2019s inception, customization has been a core tenet, and it\u2019s especially applicable with \u201cEdge.\u201d Architects and interior designers can specify their style of lever to match with the \u201cEdge\u201d escutcheon plate, plus propose individualized adaptions and modifications to satisfy a client\u2019s tastes and needs. Nickum suggested one of the optimum ways to begin the selection process is to visit the company\u2019s \u201cDesign Your Own\u201d digital tool on its website, an easily navigable program for mixing and matching components and deciding choices.",

Sam, a former Microsoft executive and VC, realized locks on the market were insecure, bulky, and dated. He vowed to create something better, focusing on security, design and performance. <br/> <br/><br/><br/>Sam rounded up a team of designers and engineers (who share 175 patents and 13-years average experience) and investors from Greylock Partners, to reimagine home access and the relationship between people and spaces. <br/><br/>Nico Lylyk, Otto\u2019s head of design, is an award-winning (Yellow Pencil Award, IDEA Award and AIDA Gold Award) Argentine designer who previously worked at Nokia. Tasked with creating a category-defining product, Nico focused on differentiating Otto with quality materials and timeless, minimalistic design.<br/><br/>But first Nico had to remove the object we most associate with locks: the key. Eliminating the key was a bold decision with security in mind\u2013keys and keypads are the most vulnerable aspects of locks. Otto is the first digital lock designed without a key. And it\u2019s no larger than the deadbolt it replaces.<br/><br/>Otto was designed to be a singular home access solution. It has built-in Wi-Fi (unique to the industry), and users can remotely check the status of their lock and lock/unlock from anywhere. By enabling Otto with Wi-Fi and ample processing power, the lock receives ongoing upgrades to features and security.<br/><br/>Otto recognizes authorized users as they arrive, allowing them to press to unlock without needing to pull out their phone--a feature unique to Otto. Using the Otto App, owners can grant access to guests 24x7 or designated times. Users can also gain access using a 4-digit entry code, with an intuitive interface akin to entering a code on a safe. <br/><br/>Otto set a new industry standard in lock testing. The team developed its own fleet of robots to test the device, slamming it over 100,000 times at 60Gs of force (two or three times more than the average door slam), and putting it through 250,000+ cycles of locking and unlocking to test durability. Otto\u2019s design is built to last: durable, reliable, and secure.<br/><br/>A well-designed product delivers an \u201cah-ha\u201d moment. Otto feels different yet familiar. It achieves the unexpected, but in ways that anticipate your needs. <br/><br/>The best product of the year should raise the bar. It should change our lives in small but meaningful ways. After experiencing Otto, we can\u2019t imagine going back to what was. Despite years of hype, digital locks have yet to be adopted. Homeowners have been stuck with the nearly century-old deadbolt &amp; key. <br/><br/>Until now. The Otto Digital Lock is unlike any other, demonstrating clear advances in security, design, and performance.",

The hoods are available in chimney-style wall mount and the Ravenna features a smoke-gray glass canopy. In addition, the hoods are equipped with BriteStrip\u2122 LED lighting, ICON Touch\u00ae Controls and Airflow Control Technology (ACT\u2122). <br/><br/>The Black Stainless Steel hoods all include Zephyr\u2019s new BriteStrip\u2122 LED lighting and ICON Touch\u00ae Controls that seamlessly integrate into the hood\u2019s canopy. Users can easily control the 5-speeds, delay-off function and auto reminders. Zephyr also incorporated its exclusive Airflow Control Technology (ACT\u2122) - technology that gives builders and developers the freedom to install range hoods with maximum blower CFM, without having to compromise power or design.<br/><br/>Zephyr\u2019s Black Stainless Steel hoods are made with Solid Titanium that is transported on the stainless steel through a Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) process. This makes the material more uniform and durable than a traditional coating process. The PVD process is also an eco-friendly technology (in contrast to chemical and galvanic surface treatments) that is clean and dry with no hazardous materials involved, and does not generate chemical waste or water pollution.<br/><br/>The successful launch of Zephyr\u2019s Black Stainless Steel hoods proves that designers and homeowners want options when it comes to their appliance finishes in the kitchen.

The new Frigidaire FS Induction Range (FFIF3054TS) streamlines, simplifies and quickens the cooking process. The induction technology brings water to a boil 50 percent faster than conventional ovens and heats pans faster so it takes less time to cook. The cooktop cools quickly since the heat is created in the pan itself, meaning it\u2019s far less likely for the cooktop to cause a burn. Induction also allows for much more precise control of heat, with more temperature increments and better performance at very low heat settings for more even results every time. Finally, the technology makes clean-up far less-intensive. Since the cooktop seldom gets very hot, food doesn't burn onto it. This means a splatter, a spill or a pasta-sauce pop calls for a quick swipe of the sponge, not a good, long scrub.",

Targetti and Gensler have collaborated to introduce a new way of seeing\u201d Light\u201d as an Emotion versus\u201d Light\u201d as a technical color. <br/><br/>The EMOTIONS COLLECTION is a strategically designed collection of custom LED lighting colors developed specifically to take the guesswork and lighting calculations out of selecting the right color for interior lighting. Inspiration was derived from sample project palette\u2019s that spanned across multiple industries from Retail, Hospitality, Commercial lighting and more. Targetti utilized their advanced color methodology to create specific illumination colors that best complement each palette based on the hues, textures and overall emotion that space needs to emit. Each combination of color mixed LEDs was carefully selected, tested and blended in special groups of common Spectral Radiation data (CCT, CRI, x/y coordinates) to deliver the ideal combination of color and tone to best complement the hues, textures and aura of the specific palettes\u2019.<br/><br/>What one experiences as a warm or cool color temperature can be experienced totally different depending on the built environment around it. Color can also be perceived in a dissimilar way depending on the source that illuminates it. Traditionally, colors are selected by a perceived notion of the ideal color temperature, CRI or other standard methodologies. However, color is ideally selected not only based upon the color temperature, the kind of source and its color rendering, but most of all according to the spectral distribution of the source. We understand that color is a perception that is affected and influenced by the similarities of ALL common Spectral Radiation data. <br/><br/>Our research took us across the United States to six of Gensler\u2019s largest offices where we held interviews with interior designers from their various studios. Over the span of these visits, designers were asked to create the \u201cperfect light\u201d for their project, culminating in over 150 different data points. By applying digital technology, we were able to control the wavelength of the spectrum separately. Much like a music composer arranges a finite number of notes to create surprising harmonies, we distribute single wave lengths that compose tones of different intensities to create a different spectrum with its own harmony. The result is a light that distributes a specific ambient to enhance the perception and emotions the designer is trying to achieve. <br/><br/>Out of the thousands of data points that were calculated and derived from the field research, we distilled this data to create the first 11 typologies of interiors conditions for the Emotions Collection. By using this advanced color philosophy, we have the ability and technology to offer the exact spectrum a designer wants to use to accent and illuminate any environment. While the methodology was simple in many ways, the outcome has produced a profound new way of addressing lighting in designing interior spaces.",

The collection includes two new acoustic fixtures \u2014 Static and Echo \u2014 that each provide an architectural lighting solution, sound absorption, and natural texture to effectively create a new category of lighting possibilities. <br/><br/>Static is a beam-shaped modular lighting solution that delivers both high performance lighting and acoustic value. Using some of the highest efficiency LED modules on the market, Static offers two directional lighting and has 1% dimming capabilities. Echo, a fixture consisting of a series of angled fins, is intended to be specified as a system of fixtures to create a striking geometric ceiling landscape with the unique ability to provide both a lighting and sound solution.<br/><br/>While LightArt traditionally uses 3form materials, the Acoustic Collection features a new material for the first time in the company\u2019s eleven year history \u2014 50% recycled PET felt \u2014 a material that provides a contemporary aesthetic while adding softness and texture to overhead lighting. LightArt tested the acoustic performance of the material at the largest reverberation chamber in the world - NWAA Labs in Elma, Washington. Static\u2019s material and assembly received an NRC rating ranging from .80 to 1.00, proving the fixture\u2019s high performance capabilities. <br/><br/>Lighting offers an opportunity to put an acoustic solution closer to the source of sound, which increases the efficiency of the absorption, while also offering a more seamless way to integrate solutions into the environment. Both Static and Echo can be arrayed for significant absorption coverage in spaces where poor acoustics can be distracting such as open workplace environments, conference rooms, classrooms and restaurants. This new line of high performance lighting aims to help designers improve communication, enhance interactions and create harmony in active environments.",

Conventional LED lighting isn\u2019t perfect either. Some manufacturers choose to compromise by using multiple smaller LEDs, which can create inefficient, ineffective lighting. Neglecting to protect those LEDs from heat can damage their phosphorous coating, thereby degrading brightness and color.<br/> <br/>People have different needs, across different spaces, at different times throughout the day. And, for optimal visual conditions, each one requires different light levels. That\u2019s why, with the new Cu-Beam Duo suspended light, Dyson has designed a powerful, combined up and down light that has full, flexible illumination control.<br/> <br/>The Cu Beam\u2122 up-light and down-light were the first of the Dyson suspended light technology. The Cu-Beam Duo joins the range with a controlled pool of powerful illumination that\u2019s ideal for both meeting tables and office desks, also open spaces such as atriums, foyers, and general office lighting.<br/> <br/>With adjustable one-touch shutters and a reflective surface, Ricochet\u2122 technology converts unwanted down light into up light, preventing light being wasted. For up light, closing the adjustable shutters allows recovery of unwanted down light. It reflects it upwards, to maximize lumen output and provide very high efficacy. For down light, opening the shutters allows more lumens to go downwards, to maximize downward light distribution onto the task plane.<br/> <br/>The Cu-Beam Duo combined up and down light with full flexible control. Directing light where it\u2019s needed provides optimal visual conditions, preventing wasted light and helping to reduce eye strain. Light precisely where you need it and alters to suit changing needs throughout the day.<br/><br/>By employing Heat pipe technology, which is more commonly found in satellites and microprocessor technology, Cu-Beam\u2122 suspended lights direct heat away from the LED \u2014 sustaining brightness for up to 180,000 hours.1 All with no bulbs to change, helping to save on costs and maintenance.<br/> <br/>For more information, visit www.dyson.com/lighting or call 855-720-6378.<br/> <br/>1Calculated lifetime based on LED L70.",

ACS has exhaustively tested slip formulas to arrive at the precise color and warmth of translucency Andrea wanted to achieve. The shapes are cast in plaster molds formed from Andrea Claire's signature bamboo Polyhedrons. Because the plaster is very sensitive the porcelain in turn retains traces of the bamboo's texture. Each surface is therefore slightly varied and dynamic. In this work Andrea explores both form and surface, while offering a timeless hand-crafted custom product. <br/>These mobile chandeliers can hang from 1 to 7 stems, and grow from 7 light points to more than 20.<br/>ACS was fortunate to have the first of this collection installed in 2016 in a gorgeous new residence on Martha's Vineyard designed by Robert A.

The story of the tree is coded in each cut piece as every piece is meticulously cut and hand sanded to create a silky smooth surface to hand finish.

The chandelier is engineered of a wrought iron frame finished in rich antique brass and embellished with dark walnut cut in a honeycomb shape. <br/><br/>Designer Jamie Beckwith is known for her prestige wood surfacing treatments for both floor and vertical surfaces. Ms. Beckwith shares, \" I believe we are pushing boundaries with these new lighting concepts. We are taking a substrate that sometimes can feel bulky or heavy and reinterpreting it into a decorative element that truly is as beautiful as a crystal or a glass chandelier.\"<br/><br/>Jamie Beckwith Collection was inspired to take 2-dimensional wood components used for flooring and wall applications and create 3-dimensional ornaments for the collaboration with Currey lighting.

Based on experimentation with the potential of LEDs, a technology that permits separation into very small units, Mesh is a dramatic and highly innovative project.<br/><br/>A lamp of great theatrical impact whose almost transparent structure, composed of a network of flexible cables with LED sources positioned at their intersections, conceals the complexity of the design, dematerializing it to make room for only the light, the true protagonist. The particular structure permits exceptional freedom in the control of luminance: it is possible to govern the intensity of the light and to choose which portions of the lamp to turn on. Mesh is available in two sizes.<br/><br/>\u201cI set out to create a lamp by starting with this capacity for spatial separation of LEDs, scattering them to optimize the read of light, but above all with the aim of giving each of these points of light its own independence. I wanted to make a lamp that lets you control the position and the quantity of light, a flexible object to adapt to space and the needs of the user. To organize the breakdown of the luminous points I used parameters similar to those identified by Fibonacci in nature, like the arrangement of the seeds in a sunflower, the eye-shaped features of a male peacock's plumage, or the complex forms of a head of cabbage. A precise sequence that inspired me for the distribution of the lights in space.\u201d<br/><br/>Material: Structure in steel, lenses in polycarbonate<br/><br/>How it Work: Mesh is controlled by a dedicated ele ronic board which is located in the canopy.<br/>In order to control Mesh you need 4 wires: two to operate the standard ON/OFF switch and two to operate a \u201cnormally open switch\u201d (push switch).

In order to reproduce this stunning view of stars, a radiant light fixture was created to leave an impression on visitors of the presentation centre. This seven-chandelier showpiece design is based on the seven Asteres Planetai of ancient Greek myth, referring to the planets that are visible to the naked eye. To illustrate this, each four-pointed star chandelier is surrounded by a circular inlay of metal trims. Suspended from polished black metal, the seven chandeliers allude to our neighbouring planets shining brilliantly in the night sky.<br/><br/>The seven repeating chandeliers convey a seamless motion across the ceiling, prompting viewers to follow along with the design. The black mirror plate provides a distinct contrasting backdrop --adding emphasis to the lights. The light design spreads further into the physical space by manifesting downwards through illuminated columns, culminating into its own reflection in a polished marble floor. The fluid light movements across the room help achieve a sense of unity and balance. <br/><br/>As the primary space in the presentation centre, the sales area plays a multifaceted role. It provides an excellent first impression while simultaneously serving as a business space. This feature scales perfectly with the grand room. With the extensive use of naturally appealing, luxurious finishes in the open sales area, it was only appropriate to complement this with the right quality and energy of lighting; working to embrace the centre's visitors with open arms.<br/><br/>A chandelier of this magnitude had two primary issues: time and cost. Our extensive experience has taught us that good planning and preparation is always key. The design and installation of the chandeliers needed to be realistically achievable within a relatively short time frame. To ensure a timely completion, we maintained a constant line of communication with project consultants to coordinate key items as quickly as possible while providing an efficient, sensible construction schedule to prevent delays. In using a tried and true design feature repeatedly, it ensured that production and installation costs were curtailed. Practical elements such as the mechanical air supply and return grills were designed to be almost invisible. They were structured to flow seamlessly with the light fixture, while the inlay of metal trims was designed simultaneously as a core visual element and essential structural support.",

Crafted from solid brass and distinct in form, a graphic cage - in a lite antique finish - becomes a study in repetition with ten layers at varying heights. Crystal diffusers in each of the cages mimic the sunlight that falls between the branches of the Northern California redwoods. Each solid brass cage is carefully crafted to achieve the angle, proportion and scale; the result in the chandelier is a work of art.

This new series expands Alison\u2019s existing body of work \u2013 drawing on historic forms to create a contemporary expression -- but continues Berger\u2019s career-long exploration of the qualities of light.<br/><br/>The Lyra constellation of stars, which is said to look like Orpheus\u2019 lyre, inspired the name of this series. Berger has long been inspired by the cosmos, as well as by the instruments that man has devised to see the unseen, such as microscopes and telescopes. As always, she marries her interest in scientific esoterica with her profound talent as a designer to create new forms and finishes that create an interplay with light.<br/><br/>The entire Lyra Series is based on a delicate bronze armature, from which hang circular lenses and reflectors. The series is scalable \u2013 from a one \u201cstar\u201d sconce to a 7\u20194\u201d structure with 13 \u201coptical comets\u201d (called Lyra No. 13) \u2013 with two sizes in between, Lyra No.3 and Lyra No. 5. Hand-carved optical crystal lenses surround the filament bulb, to capture and magnify the kinetic energy of illumination, and mirror reflectors punctuate the illumination.<br/><br/>For the first time in her career, Berger is experimenting with colored metal finishes for this line. In addition to her standard medium amber bronze patina, this series includes lacquered bronze in oxblood, white, and green with golden bronze highlights. These finishes lend the pieces an additional sense of luminescence; they all seem to glow from within. In this use of color, Berger was inspired by tones of the velvet boxes that were used to transport these devices of measurement.",

These two horizontal beams sandwich a \u00be\u201d thick piece of etched, water white glass which, together, form an upside down \u201cT\u201d. Two strips of 3000\u02daK LEDs provide warm up and down-light and are wired as dual circuits, which allows each light source to be dimmed separately. A diffuser on the top of the fixture diffuses glowing up-lighting, while light radiating from the bottom of the glass is soft yet strong. Once hung, each of the two stems can be adjusted independently to level the pendant. The T-Light comes in a myriad of standard powder coat finish options: Cinnamon Bronze; Rubbed Bronze; Silver Fog; Black Granite; Gossamer Aluminum; Gloss White; Golden Gate Orange; and Coffee Bean. The fixture can also be powder coated to compliment any interior scheme. The fixture is available in 5\u2019, 6\u2019 and 7\u2019 lengths.<br/><br/>The idea of the T-light, according to Joshua Aidlin, \u201c\u2026 was to create an extremely quiet linear pendant that honestly and elegantly expresses its structure while providing directional light above and below.\u201d <br/><br/>The T-Light was co-designed by Aidlin Darling Design\u2019s Peter Larsen, principal, and Adrienne Swiatocha, designer. While Aidlin Darling has been awarded regional, national and international design awards, Boyd Lighting is also the recipient of numerous awards for lighting design. The relationship between the firms goes back decades to when Dave Darling (then with Brayton and Hughes) helped design the landmark Boyd building at 944 Folsom Street in San Francisco.",

These dynamic lamps distribute light with functionality and grace while conjuring the movements of<br/>celestial bodies.<br/>The Orbital series is an evolution of the mobile. At its heart is the proprietary rotatable connector. Minimal,<br/>sturdy and unhindered by wires it allows the wood members to rotate around each other smoothly and<br/>steadily. The interplay of the arms is captivating and welcomes interaction. Virtually frictionless, you can give<br/>them a nudge to spin around effortlessly or set them in a desired configuration.<br/><br/>There are two variations in the series and gravitationally speaking they are opposites. The suspended<br/>model is Orbit. Remarkably, when inverted it maintains its balance to become Floorbit, the floor standing<br/>version. They are each made up of one to five arms, of solid glue laminated wood, in either straight or<br/>curved options. New for the fall is the Strata: the CNC cut version made from maple plywood. The quality of the LED light is bright, warm and dimmable. Components are made from machined brushed aluminium. Beyond the models available for retail sale, a multitude of custom creations are possible, including a motorized option.<br/><br/>The lamps\u2019 unique effects recall dewdrops on blades of grass, the motion of clock gears and the playfulness<br/>of spirograph. The Orbital series embodies the spirit of its origins through craftsmanship and choice of<br/>local birch, Douglas fir, western red cedar or Sitka spruce. Custom creations are now easy to make thanks to several years of experience and development.<br/><br/> Barn-Barn design is lead by Mich DuVernet who embraces a hands-on approach to his work that merges<br/>old-school techniques with new technologies. Nestled in the mountains of Canada near Nelson BC, his<br/>converted barn now design studio and workshop has evolved into a space for exploration, fabrication and<br/>play.<br/><br/>The Orbital series will have a sculptural and ever changing presence in any space. Barn-Barn design<br/>invites inquiry about how the Orbital series can compliment or inform your vision.",

Its lines are harmonious and organic; it brightens the space it is in and it blends in with nature where there are no straight lines.<br/><br/>It is a lamp made of very high-density polyurethane, which is a very hard and resistant material that is perfect for public spaces. But the Cornet's use is very versatile. It can provide direct lighting like a bollard or more extensive lighting for illuminating larger surfaces. The Cornet lamp family works in the connectivity of spaces; a value that Alex Fern\u00e1ndez Camps always upholds. It is mainly used as a bollard lamp but can quickly connect with a wider reality: interior wall lamps, or the post version for intermediate spaces. In all of its designs, Cornet includes a dimmable LED source that distributes light through the lamp's undulating layers, creating an atmosphere that is natural, slightly broken, but never dominant. <br/><br/>Cornet is a highly technical project, yet full of life. One of the most interesting moments occurred during the working process when Alex was surprised to discover that the Cornet's lines breathed the organic functionality of Gaud\u00ed's buildings, which he had visited as a boy with his father. But the coincidences did not stop there; his full name was Antoni Gaud\u00ed i Cornet, and Alex's studio is on Calle Cornet i M\u00e1s (the engineer who made the metal structures for some of the famous Barcelona markets). An entirely magical crossing of lines involved in the history of this unique Bover lamp made in Barcelona.<br/><br/>In the words of Alex Fern\u00e1ndez Camps: \u201cCornet surprised me during the process, and still amazes me every time I see it.

            "description_html": "Austrian designer Rainer Mutsch designs Orchid for Axolight, a collection of lamps with two separate yet complementary souls: one outer \u2013 that of nature, exuded by its flower shaped diffuser and its rod; the other, more hidden, is high-tech with avant-garde LED technology.<br/><br/>Orchid is a mix of emotions and technology stripped to the essentials.<br/><br/>Rainer Mutsch explains how these souls have merged in Orchid: \"As a designer, I feel that nature is a major source of inspiration. In Orchid\u2019s case I was studying how buds are connected to stems: and that\u2019s what sparked the idea to develop a multidirectional floor lamp that could include direct lighting and diffused lighting in a single item. For the shape of the diffuser I was inspired by the funnel shape of the flower; I\u2019m fascinated by how the flower seems relatively fragile near the stem and how then it reveals all its beauty when it blooms. Experimenting with these shapes I began sketching out a new diffuser, which thanks to its shape is capable of visualising the spread of the light.\u201d<br/><br/>The LED technology is the second key factor in the design. The shape of the diffuser, made out of aluminium, prevents overheating, thus ensuring maximum duration of the light source. The outcome is a compact and efficient diffuser that couldn\u2019t be possible with an incandescent lamp.<br/><br/>Including two suspension lamps, a floor lamp, a wall lamp and a ceiling lamp, Orchid comes in white or sand finish. It is so sculpturesque that it takes centre stage in the space even when turned off and stands out the most especially when a number of lamps are used in combination. Precisely thanks to its versatility, it works both in residential settings and in contract projects of a larger scope.",

With a shared taste for simplicity and \u201cintelligent subtraction,\u201d the two studios developed timeless fixtures suited to a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments, uniquely solving common interior design problems. <br/>The Hoist, a pendant, sconce, and flush mount, was designed as an elegant solution for a routine problem; hospitality renovations often lack electrical access to hang a pendant light where it is desired. The question became, how to make the electrical cord part of a larger gesture? Having identified the out-of-reach electrical outlet as a routine problem, the studios adapted the standard electrical cord as an integral, stylish component of Hoist\u2019s overall design. Swagged and offered with generous cable length, the cord allows greater opportunities for where a pendant light can be installed. A knurled cord grip gives infinite freedom to locate a light source. The shade is available in a variety of colors and diameters, with a sconce version as well. Waterproof, the highly durable exterior is also suitable for outdoor installation, creating the possibility for a cohesive interior and exterior. <br/>We developed tools for designers to create their own atmosphere. Thoughtfully considered and meticulously executed, the pieces elevate practical features like accent finishes and durable materials with a relaxed elegance, adding endless possibilities for installation.",

Inspired by the patina of the effects that time has on a material, we sought to create a light fixture that expresses simplicity, patina, and the passage of time by taking a slow, hand-made, artisanal approach. <br/><br/>The Dead City Pendant is made of micarta (a material traditionally used for hunting knife handles) in an innovative way. <br/>Linen, the classic beginning of a painting, and epoxy resin is used to form a composite. The cylindrical shape is crafted from multiple layers of fabric hand-rolled onto an aluminum formwork. Once hardened and removed from its mold, the rough piece is then spun on a lathe and machined to its final shape revealing its layered construction. The shade armature is milled from solid brass hex rod and then assembled. <br/><br/>The Dead City Pendant is beguiling in the way light interacts with its materiality. The magical translucency of the revealed layers of lathed linen offers an ethereal, timeless glow once illuminated. Whether turned on or off, the surfaces multifaceted strata conjure a landscape or ruin. Each hand-made piece is unique and we relish in the nuances of the way light permeates the shade. When illuminated from within, the darkest parts of the fixture transform into a warm amber glow and reveal the subtle patterns of the fabric and its layered construction. <br/><br/>We seek to create complex connections through our design work, weaving history, process, and aesthetics to achieve subtle and nuanced results.",

As part of the domestic launch of KUMIKO.<br/><br/>TANAKA, known for her work at the Freer and Sackler galleries at The Smithsonian Institute, as well as Grand Central Terminal Centennial Holiday Light Show in New York and Disney World\u2019s Epcot Japan Pavilion Renovation, is committed to using sustainable energy-efficient lighting solutions in all her projects.<br/>Her work exemplifies her goal of creating a unique symbiotic relationship between architecture and lighting<br/>experience. As a native Japanese designer living and practicing in New York, Tanaka wanted to channel both cultural identities into this product.<br/><br/>\u201cKumiko\u201d is a Japanese term for a traditional, highly crafted piece of functional art made from wood. \u201cI<br/>wanted to bring the spirit of this tradition into contemporary products and technology such as OLED light.\u201d<br/>TANAKA states. \u201cI was able to use the thinness of Kaneka's OLED magnetic module (0.33\u201d) to achieve a<br/>product that can be hung like artwork on a wall. I also imagined my product as a solution for areas where<br/>there is limited access for natural light. I wanted to be able to add KUMIKO like adding back-lit shoji<br/>screens into any space. I carried the KUMIKO pattern through to texture the mirror when the light is off, so<br/>it\u2019s a beautiful design element on or off.\u201d",

The result is Corner Office; a simple solution that helps define personal space and incorporates wellness and visual privacy. <br/>Working closely with the designers, Pablo Pardo from Pablo Designs explains \u201c Corner Office is a result of a great collaboration between Peter, Michael and myself. Our challenge was to create a new breed of product to respond to the demands of today's new type of productivity, while offering surprise and delight.\u201d The result is a dynamic and flexible system that combines the efficiencies of mass production, the flexibility of custom materials and configurations for expressing personal preferences, and the carbon-reducing sustainability of flat shipping and local assembly for international markets. <br/>The system includes three elements: a glare-free, fully dimmable LED corner task light that incorporates three powerful USB ports featured in its armature (to charge phone and laptop devices); a set of optional acoustic deterrent fabric panels; and an optional pocket accessory that provides a place to rest a phone or tablet keeping the desk clutter-free. Elements are made up of aluminum and recycled fabric, that offer a familiar softness to the touch. The LED light is designed to provide up 50K hours of energy-efficient and maintenance-free illumination and is 97% recyclable. <br/>Corner Office addresses multiple combinations and creative expressions in the office, home and hospitality environments. It is dynamic in visual expression, structural shape and detail and requires no tools to install it. While its overall aesthetic is simple, it reveals subtle intricacy in the places where elements come together. The sculptural origami-like shape of the panels outline a distinctive profile that is identifiable at a distance, while a refined magnetic connectors system provide highly flexible desktop planning for individuals, effortlessly and within minutes.<br/>Lightweight but grounded, the system imparts a sense of personal space in a group environment. \u201cCorner Office comes to life in open plan working spaces,\u201d explains designer Peter Stathis. \u201cThe geometry is visually interesting but not overpowering and complements the landscape and surrounding interiors. It provides an ergonomic upgrade to existing tables and desks.\u201d The fully dimmable LED task lamp provides focused and shaped lighting. Aluminum parts contain recycled content and are fully recyclable. \u201cFor me, a product needs to offer a solution to a problem while responding to a certain ethos of a time,\u201d Pablo says. \u201cIt\u2019s about how it helps us to adapt our tools to the new ways in which we operate .

Moreover, it is a design that helps others: each light fixture sold will feed one child for an entire school year thanks to a collaboration with the NGO Mary\u2019s Meals.<br/><br/>HOOK is a portable lamp with a hook. It's free, it needs no installation. You can move it anywhere you would like given that it comes with a 5-meter cable so it can follow you to wherever you need it without having to worry about wall outlets. If, on the contrary, what you need is to have it near you, its geometry allows for a perfect roll-up of the cable so that it does not become a mess and using it feels comfortable and nice. <br/>Regarding functionality, it is a lamp and several lamps at the same time: it can work as a table lamp, as a ceiling lamp, as a wall lamp and even as a lantern. Its portability is helped by its size, which is completely adapted to the hand of the user, its long cable and its hook. It can be placed on any surface; it is designed to work perfectly on a bar, a shelf or a flat surface. In addition, Hook comes with a variety of accessories that turn it into a nightstand, a magazine rack and even a shelf. Lighting and maximum functionality from an elemental design filled with emotions. <br/><br/>Hook is revolutionary because of how it implements environmental aspects and the reduction of the toxic elements in the design and manufacturing stages of the product. It is one of the first interior design products made from recycled plastics and, at the same time, one of the first lamps with PVC-free wiring. In addition, since it is not enough to simply state it is eco-friendly; we prove it including a complete environmental product declaration. This lamp is made by a two-part recycled injected polypropylene housing and a translucent virgin-polypropylene diffuser. The cable is coated with silicone: an innocuous material both during its use and at the end of its lifecycle. For its design and its materials, CO2 emission reducing strategies have been implemented, as well as the highest standards to make it recyclable. Hook is ecological given that for its manufacturing process, only recycled plastics and materials free of toxic substances are used, avoiding the PVC for covering the wires, which makes it one of the most eco-innovative lamps on the market. In addition, this is a lamp made 100% in Spain.",

It is bright enough for one to be able to navigate through a space, but dim enough to discover other senses beyond the eyes.

The system is comprised of three elements: a glare-free, fully dimmable LED task light that incorporates power ports featured in its armature; a set of optional acoustic deterrent fabric panels; and an optional pocket accessory, that provides a place to store a phone or tablet, keeping things clutter-free.<br/><br/>With today\u2019s portable wireless technologies and cloud-based computing, many workers are in team environments or places other than the office. Privacy, power and quality lighting are necessary everywhere, as everyplace is a workplace. By providing these elements all in an easy to set up unit, Corner Office brings heightened efficiency and well-being to any desk. When used singly, Corner Office provides a quiet alcove or touchdown space for one. When arranged in multiples, it provides individual privacy within larger, open shared spaces.<br/><br/><br/>Corner Office represents a new typology of workplace productivity tool. Equal parts task light, power charging station and acoustic/privacy panel system, Corner Office is a simple solution that helps define personal space by incorporating productive elements to support wellness and user-controlled privacy. Density in open-plan offices will only continue to rise and, while this sort of clustering of people is essential for employees to communicate, share knowledge and innovate, many workers are finding themselves suffering from distractions and lack of privacy. This often impedes the collaborative mission these layouts are designed to foster. Corner Office provides the attributes of a fully composed workstation with immediacy and ease.<br/><br/>While its overall aesthetic is simple, Corner Office reveals subtle intricacy in the places where elements come together. The sculptural origami-like shape of the panels outline a distinctive profile that is identifiable at a distance while refined, machined aluminum connectors provide self-evident, effortless reconfigurability for individuals or teams.<br/><br/>Corner Office Light is offered in a neutral white color and the panels are available in various felt colors. This allows it to quietly recede into the background, blending into the interior envelope, or enliven a space by adding a shot of accent color to any desk or tabletop. In addition to felt, forthcoming panel finishes and material options will include various wood veneers, perforated leathers and translucent plastics, as well as COM fabrics.",

By separating individual pieces that comprise it - the light source, the base, decoration elements and electrical wiring \u2013 Anastasio brought out each part\u2019s own structural and aesthetic characteristics. Filo\u2019s essential character is the result of playing with the fundamentals of decorative objects, elevating elements that are not traditionally considered decorative, alongside the adornments.<br/><br/>The colorful electrical wire is wrapped in fabric. Varying shapes of Murano glass spheres contrast with the minimal ceramic diffuser in a rhythmic dialog. These elements give Filo the resemblance to a delicate necklace with colorful glass beads.<br/><br/>The lamp comes in eight color combinations, from light watercolor tones to transparent hues of Murano glass, to bright, bold accents of the fluorescent cord, each with distinct personalities. The diversity of options makes it possible for Filo to work in a variety of residential and contract settings. Users also have the ability to string Filo\u2019s wire in whichever way they desire.",

That's how a design with more than ten references is reached that satisfies both residential and contract sector needs. A family of lamps that speak the same language but in which each one has its own personality.<br/><br/><br/>With the Drip, the goal was clear from the beginning: make a cascade pendant lamp. One of the most outstanding features of the Drip is its diversity of sizes. We find versions of 1, 6, 7, 12, 24, 36 and 48 lights only in suspension. The biggest has a diameter of 1 meter, which gives it a great visual impact. Any of them, although they are drawn from standard measures, can be customized at the request of the client. And so, starting from this initial premise, ideas of new typologies began to emerge: several wall lamps, two table lamps, a floor version with a support tray and USB connection, and also a specific solution for libraries.<br/><br/><br/>Drip's small screen is made of borosilicate glass, finer and more delicate than blown glass. \"I wanted the material to be very tasteful, almost like a candy,\" says Christophe. The choice of glass is intimately related to the light that creates the Drip. In the words of its creator: \"I was looking for a very bright light, and the translucent glass and its shape contribute to it. The light source is an LED that is hidden so that light is the only protagonist. Then, when the light is projected and reflected in the materials that are found along the way, it creates a set of sparkles and shadows. All of which enriches the object. \" Its light is intimate, but it also has a practical utility for those who are nearby. \"I always bear in mind the space where a lamp is going to be located because that is where it becomes meaningful\" explains Christophe. The Drip is intended for application in both residential and contract projects. Thanks to its multiple applications it works very well in all hotel spaces, in public areas as well as in rooms.<br/><br/><br/>The relationship with the Drip, as Christophe says, goes in crescendo. First, it seduces you from a distance, enough for you to want to get closer to it. Once you are by its side you like its design, and that motivates you to take the last step and turn it on. Then, the magic reaches its maximum splendor",

Archoterra's great innovation lies in the fact that it is not only made from a recycled material but that it also has a unique aesthetic evoking a combination of paper, stone &amp; concrete and is lightweight and easy to install with minimal seams. Archoterra is made in the USA from 90% post-consumer recycled materials sourced locally with a hands-on manufacturing process.<br/><br/>Archoterra's product line is organized into FLAT and DIMENSIONAL 4'x8' sheets, and offers 38 colors and 12 Dimensional patterns in both smooth or textured surfaces. Thickness ranges from 1/16\" for Flat sheets to 1/2\" for the deeper Dimensionals. <br/><br/>FLAT sheets come in 38 varieties:<br/> 12 SOLIDS such as \"White Pages\", \"Ledger\", and \"Newsprint\"<br/> 20 MIXES - LIQUID &amp; PUREE such as \"Crumpled Concepts\", \"Passport\" and \"Calendar\"<br/> 6 METALLICS such as \"Wedding Invite\", \"Carbon Copy\" and \"Chocolate Wrapper\"<br/><br/>DIMENSIONAL sheets come in 12 standard patterns with articulated surfaces that create a three-dimensional shadowed effect. Each pattern is available in any solid, mix or metallic color. Patterns include linear options such as \"V-Groove\", \"Wide Wale\" and \"Curtain\" and geometric options such as \"Weave\", \"Bad Tile Job and \"Origami\".<br/><br/>All products are available with 5 different finish levels: unfinished, matte, satin, semi-gloss and gloss.<br/><br/>Archoterra is completely customizable with respect to color, additives and patterns. Almost any custom color can be achieved with a variation in blends of raw materials and by adding natural pigments. Unique aesthetics can be achieved with additives such as mica-chip, natural fibers, and other organic materials. Any custom Dimensional pattern can be created, giving the designer or end-user creative freedom.<br/><br/>In contrast to other architectural surfaces on the market, Archoterra is lightweight, easy to cut and install with basic tools and does not require extensive backing and/or substrate as would other panels (MDF, gypsum, metal, resin), tile or stone. Shipping, handling and installation are therefore easier and more affordable. Sheets can be adhered to many different substrates or wall surfaces using wallpaper adhesive. When installed over type-X gyp board, Archoterra has a Class A fire rating. Seams are extremely minimal between sheets and the Dimensionals are designed for a continuous pattern both vertically and horizontally.<br/><br/>As an alternative to the 4'x8' sheets, Archoterra offers a wet mix that can be directly applied onto a surface in the field for a monolithic and seamless installation. The Archoterra wet mix can form to compound curves, angled surfaces and other irregular and unusual conditions.",

            "description_html": "Following the celebrated launch of Dekton Trilium in 2016, Cosentino added three new colors to its Dekton Industrial Collection. Drawing inspiration from the award-winning Dekton Trilium, leading architect and designer Daniel Germani envisioned three new designs that capture the organic texture and essenese of weather-worn stone and aged metals. The industrial Collection is intended to be both relaxed and modern through its rough, expressive aesthetic, reestablishing concrete, metal and brick as material protagonists in modern design. To create a rich design with varied subtle effects, the Industrial collection has a never before seen matte-gloss finish.<br/><br/>Unlike the materials that sparked the Industrial Collection\u2019s design, Dekton is incredibly smooth to the touch and impervious to the elements, including scratches, stains, UV rays and temperature shock. Its ultra-durable performance makes it ideal solution for an array of indoor and outdoor applications, including countertops, facades, cladding, flooring, stairs and more. It is available in large format, which allows for seamless creative possibilities for architects and designers for both residential and commercial projects. <br/><br/>\u201cThe Industrial Collection celebrates the beauty of metals and cement as they transform over time,\u201d Germani says. \u201cImperfections caused by oxidation and natural degradation create unique colors that capture the richness and depth of organic processes. It was only through the incomparable technology of Dekton that we were able to explore these processes and subsequently create these designs.\u201d <br/><br/>In the spirit of Cosentino\u2019s continued commitment to sustainability, 80 percent of the materials used in <br/>two of the collection\u2019s four colors (Trilium and Radium) come from excess materials from the Dekton manufacturing process. Sustainability is an integral part of the Cosentino brand; a portion of all R+D funds are allocated to the creation of environmentally friendly products to help Cosentino achieve zero emissions in an effort to maintain clean air, support energy efficiency, manage water effectively and dispose of waste correctly. <br/><br/>The Dekton Industrial Collection includes the following four colors:<br/>\u2022\tOrix mimics the industrial appearance of eroded cement: steely, cold and broken. Its multi-tonal color palette of greys, blues and greens creates contrast between old and new.<br/>\u2022\tNilium subtly blends hues of silver and white, offering a minimal approach. It simultaneously conveys the delicate elegance and inherent strength of metal.<br/>\u2022\tRadium resembles acid-washed steel, juxtaposing warm earth tones against cold blue and green hues. Similarly to Trilium, it is manufactured using the same sustainable production methods, using up to 80 percent recycled materials.<br/>\u2022\tTrilium, the first of the collection, captures the visual texture and color variation of aged and oxidized stainless steel with hues ranging from deep grays and blacks to rusty undertones, giving it an incredibly genuine appearance.",

The line draws on Forms+Surfaces\u2019 expertise in two arenas \u2013 artistic cast glass design and sophisticated glass lamination technologies \u2013 to create a line of architectural glass with unrivaled visual potential.<br/><br/>By definition, Levels glass is architectural kiln cast glass laminated with color, graphic or image interlayers. Each design pairs an artisanal texture, cast on a handcrafted mold and fired in a kiln, with an interlayer optimized specifically for that texture. <br/> <br/>The Levels collection consists of twelve standard designs: three textures, each with one of four different color, graphic or image interlayers optimized specifically for that texture.<br/><br/>TEXTURES shape the surface appearance of Levels glass designs. Each texture has distinctive visual characteristics, tactile qualities, and ways of reflecting or refracting light. The glass itself is inherently clear.<br/><br/>INTERLAYERS add color and enrich the optical experience of each design. Three types of interlayers produce varied visual effects: Color interlayers feature solid color and offer the most subtle end results. Graphic interlayers expand the design complexity by introducing graphics in a single color. Image interlayers incorporate multiple continuous tone colors and have the most dramatic impact.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, the sculpted surfaces of Levels glass capture light on and through the glass; the interlayers add a sense of depth and dimension and accentuate plays of light, texture, color, and motion. Viewed up close or at a distance and as light and viewing angles change, each design is as captivating as it is dynamic.<br/><br/>From an applications standpoint, Levels glass gives designers new ways to bring the handcrafted beauty of textured cast glass into spaces of all kinds \u2013 including elevator interiors \u2013 and makes it easy to move cohesively across a project, from design concept to installed reality.<br/><br/>Levels Kiln Cast Glass can be fabricated in any size up to 53\u201d x 108\u201d (1346mm x 2746mm). Standard glass thickness is a nominal 6mm. End use determines finished glass dimensions.<br/><br/>BermanGlass Levels Kiln Cast glass is available exclusively in Forms+Surfaces\u2019 LEVELe Wall Cladding and Column Systems, LEVELe Elevator Interiors, and LightPlane LED Panels. Each system is designed to address mechanical details like trim pieces and mounting assemblies, so designers don\u2019t have to worry about resolving these aspects; they can simply focus on the creative process.<br/><br/>Levels Kiln Cast Glass can be easily cleaned and maintained using a mild soap or glass cleaning solution. With the decorative interlayer behind the glass, rather than surface-applied, the glass surfaces are easy to clean.<br/><br/>The use of UV-resistant inks in the printing process helps ensure that Levels interlayer colors and designs retain their integrity over time. The laminated structure also protects the interlayer artwork from surface damage and fading.<br/><br/>Levels Kiln Cast architectural glass complies with major building codes as laminated safety glass and meets numerous U.S. and Canadian industry standards.",

Available in seven new hues - Voyage, Daydream, Blush, Sprout, Zest, Harvest and Waltz - the color changing architectural film acts like a dynamic skin for architectural products, changing the color of a wall, ceiling panel or entire room with the flip of a switch. It is also fully programmable, fully reflective, low power, rugged, customizable and made in America.<br/><br/>E Ink is the inventor of several novel types of electrophoretic ink, often called electronic ink. When laminated to a plastic film, and then adhered to electronics, it creates an Electronic Paper Display (EPD). Although futuristic-sounding, electronic ink is actually a straightforward fusion of chemistry, physics and electronics. It's so much like paper, it utilizes the same pigments used in the printing industry today.<br/><br/>The two pigment electronic ink system is made up of millions of tiny microcapsules, each about the diameter of a human hair. Each microcapsule contains positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid. When a positive or negative electric field is applied, corresponding particles move to the top of the microcapsule where they become visible to the viewer. This makes the surface appear white or black at that spot. For the E Ink Prism film, various colored pigments are utilized, rather than the standardized black and white.<br/><br/>As a result, E Ink Prism\u2019s bistable ink technology can transform architectural materials into dynamic, one of a kind experiences and designs, and it doesn\u2019t stop at color. Programmable patterns and shapes can be integrated to create designs or function. Doors can indicate if a conference room is occupied, wall designs can respond to noise, temperature, or motion in the room. Whatever the idea, the opportunities are endless and only limited by a designer\u2019s imagination.",

Developed with Feruglio Engineering, an 8mm thick aluminium sheet is laser cut to create the profile and the pattern of cuts before it is folded into shape in a single motion around a form. The chair was designed by AL_A for the Victoria and Albert Museum\u2019s Exhibition Road building project in London, due to open in July 2017. AL_A have designed the Exhibition Road project that will create ambitious new spaces opening in July 2017 for the V&amp;A, the world\u2019s leading museum of art, design and performance. The diagonal incisions in the plate are designed to reduce the chair\u2019s weight and will cast beautiful shadows. The aluminium, which is typically used in aeronautical construction projects, is a very light alloy that is nonetheless able to withstand a great deal of mechanical pressure. After laser cutting into the shape needed to make each piece, the sheet is bent using a one-step process. Finally, the metal surface is smoothed, to eliminate signs of the laser cutting, and anodized or powder coated in two color variations. <br/>Flexible and comfortable, the back has been cambered with a slight spring at the junction with the seat. <br/>The chair can be used both inside and outside, with an interiors only edition in red leather bonded to the aluminium. <br/>To accompany the chair, the 8mm Table is formed by the same process and incised with the same pattern of cuts. Multiple tables can be placed end-to-end to form a longer version. <br/>The 8mm chair and table are suitable for both indoor and outdoor use and for both contract and residential applications.",

Other base options include free swivel and glides.<br/>Lightweight and easy to move, Retreat\u2019s coordinating family of wing-back, high-back, low-back<br/>and ottoman options not only allows for many possible applications\u2014a four-pack grouping of<br/>wing backs for optimum space definition; a side-by-side pairing of swivel low backs for a more<br/>open feel; a wing back and ottoman for a feet-up, individual retreat, and more\u2014but also<br/>maintains a consistent aesthetic across the workplace. <br/><br/>Allsteel worked closely with its clients on the geometry and scale of the lounges to best support active work while maintaining a more residential feeling of style and comfort. \u201cThe organic-inspired silhouette of Retreat\u2019s three lounges and corresponding ottoman is refined but approachable,\u201d said designer Niels Bendtsen. \u201cThe collection offers designers and architects the opportunity to create quietly distinctive environments that combine inviting<br/>aesthetics with work-friendly functionality. And because the pieces are compact, they can also be<br/>set along windows or in corridors and other underutilized areas, maximizing available space for<br/>offices.\u201d",

Elegant and unconventional, yet functional and accessible, Lyss embodies the \u2018think outside the box\u2019 mentality, pulling in organic materials and smart silhouettes for a chair as unique as it is beautiful.<br/> <br/>The chair's name is a reflection of its one-of-a-kind design. Derived from the Swedish word, 'lysnna,' meaning 'to listen,' Lyss was appropriately designed to facilitate intimate conversations and meaningful connections between its users. Furthered by each and every one of Lyss' carefully considered components, the chair makes for the perfect seating selection in boardrooms, lobbies, lounges, libraries, and ideation spaces. <br/> <br/>The versatility of the chair can be largely credited to Lyss' sophisticated yet contemporary aesthetic made possible by a flexible poly shell carved with subtle undulations at its summit for an eye-catching detail and added support. A delicately curved cutout in the seat's back, complemented by an A-line base, exudes modern appeal, while tactile upholstery offerings and a real oak wood base enhance the upscale styling of the chair. Juxtaposing uncommonly matched materials - a real oak wood base with an outer poly shell backing - Lyss can be celebrated for its thoughtful design and ingenuity. <br/> <br/>Lyss can also be defined by its versatility, with an aluminum base also available for spaces that follow a more traditional office design scheme. Four different base styles for four incredibly unique finished products, including refined guest and lounge design, a 4-prong glide, and flexibility-focused caster version. As customization is inherent to the chair, Lyss\u2019 poly shell is also crafted to order, with three stylish options: cotton outer poly back/smoke inner poly back, cotton outer poly back/upholstered inner back, fully upholstered outer and inner back.<br/> <br/>The handsome design comes at an accessible price point, additionally contributing to its appeal and stretching its accessibility to applications of all sizes and statures. Carl Gustav Magnusson\u2019s experience as an industrial designer, as well as an educator, is reflected in this latest body of work. With a refined eye for high-design, Carl was able to create a chair that is approachable in any setting, and embodies all of the users desires for comfort, quality, and style. Lyss was created to be timeless and not limited to a particular passing trend or design era.",

While using classic materials, the Rocking Nest Chair challenges the standard rocking chair concept.<br/><br/>Despite its relaxed expression, the Rocking nest Chair demands great precision from craftspeople to ensure that the various materials and all the moving parts interact smoothly. The structure of the chair distinguishes it from traditional rocking chairs, as the soft, stitched leather-canvas shell functions as a load-bearing part of the design. Another unconventional element is the way in which the narrow steel struts are joined to the solid wood framework. It is precisely this delicate interplay between the steel and the wood that causes the chair to appear to float.<br/><br/>The Rocking Nest Chair has been created to suit modern lifestyles, and the ingenious design can easily be folded up and put away. It is available in oak or walnut combined with stainless or powder-coated steel. The seat of the rocking chair is a combination of canvas and leather, with a leather cushion, and the upholstery is held in place by classic flag halyard.",

A lounge solution with standard provisions for integrated power, rear tables and privacy screens featuring signature stitching. The appearance and function of Bota is enhanced through carefully tailored details in the upholstery. A soft rise on each seat and fitted upholstery are used to define individual space. When viewed from above, the budding formation resembles a flower, inspiring the botanical collection name \u2013 Bota.<br/><br/>The core Bota Circlet component is a two-seat lounge, available in two radii. High and low back Circlets allow for either desk or counter height tables. Slim upholstered back privacy screens extend upward from lounge backs and provide an element of privacy while others work diligently on cantilevered rear tables. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Bota Shell is composed of upholstered back and side privacy screens with a roof canopy, available in a single, double or triple seat module. Bota Shell offers privacy in the middle of lively common spaces. Side privacy screens resemble a petal shape allowing the roof canopy to inset above the seat for ease of use. While sitting inside Bota Shell a noticeable reduction in sound is realized creating a personal focus nook. Coordinating ottomans add color and vitality while providing additional seating.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Bota offers freestanding components, including tables and a coat stand. Table tops are organically shaped with rounded corners supported by a steel column and disc plate base in metal finishes. Bota\u2019s Coat Stand takes an elliptical form made from steel wires woven together. <br/><br/>Keith Melbourne\u2019s acclaimed designs are clearly influenced by his diverse experiences, and seem to sit in a realm where engineering precision meets artistic creativity.<br/><br/>Keith studied engineering in England while working in the aerospace industry. He then moved into the international automotive industry and spent 15 years developing advanced engine and control system technology. While in the automotive industry he traveled around the world to test vehicles and manage large engineering projects. Keith Melbourne has not followed a typical path into furniture and product design.<br/><br/>Leaving his engineering career behind in search of a passion, Melbourne studied furniture design in the remote city of Perth, Western Australia. Immediately he discovered a new creative world that he loved.<br/><br/>He now lives and works, rather ironically, in Melbourne, Australia where he draws on a sophisticated knowledge of materials and manufacturing processes to develop his products. This allows him to create surprising forms that are also very manufacturable. Believing strongly in the importance of the designer/manufacturer relationship. He enjoys close collaboration with manufacturers, and their skilled workers, which allow him to develop his designs for the market.",

The design achieves this balance through the untraditional way in which natural rattan \u2014 BuzziCane\u2019s most traditional material \u2014 is incorporated into the seat\u2019s design, by emphasizing its openness and braided structure. Additionally, by having BuzziCane\u2019s sleek curved ash wood frame \u201cdrip off\u201d into the loose, informal pillows of its seat and back, the sofa provides an enticing, welcoming atmosphere, without entirely shedding its formal characteristics. <br/><br/>As a result of its multi-faceted design, BuzziCane is well-suited for many different types of environments, from lounge seating in private offices and collaborative workspaces, to hospitality settings and residential homes. It is also available as a one, two, or three seater, and in a wide range of colorful upholstery options, to meet the spatial and aesthetic needs of any space. In addition, its frame can come either in an ash natural, or an ash black stained finish. <br/><br/>With a highly adaptable personality and appearance, BuzziCane was designed in direct response to the changing state of the workplace \u2013 companies are gravitating away from the formal, and towards more comfortable, residential-inspired spaces that foster wellbeing, collaboration, and personal expression. BuzziCane\u2019s reassuring, unpretentious atmosphere not only facilitates these values, but also addresses the larger, growing necessity for flexible designs. As the line between work and life becomes increasingly blurred, versatile and highly functional products that can meet the needs of both have become crucial to the modern workforce. BuzziCane represents BuzziSpace\u2019s shift towards such products that can toe the line between residential and contract, without sacrificing aesthetics or functionality.",

Its organic form expresses comfort while visually emphasizing the contradiction of light and dark. The name Dual comes from the \u201cduality\u201d of light and dark seen visually in the transparency of the base in partially opaque knit, and the adverse textile upholstery of the top portion. <br/><br/>\u201cThe Dual Lounge is the fruit of a balanced combination of several character traits apparently in opposition,\u201d says Toan Nguyen. \u201cIts monolithic and organic shape is divided in two by a clear-cut line: the upper part is enveloping and dedicated to the user comfort, while the base is a subtle counterpoint of balance, tension and transparency. With both parts customizable with any fabric or leather on the top, and fabric or three-dimensional knitted mesh on the base, Dual Lounge is suitable to either a classic tone-on-tone or a fancy, sharp contrast matching. The low-back version stimulates a dynamic attitude and a collaborative discourse whereas the high back incites rest and relaxation.\u201d<br/><br/>The 3D knit mesh base allows for light to pass through for a balance of light and dark. The duality of materials of the upholstered seat and back and the mesh base creates a juxtaposition of materiality to create an iconic visual statement. Dual creates a balance of materiality unlike other swivel lounge chairs.<br/><br/>Dual\u2019s relaxed, lean-back posture offers an alternative choice throughout the day to support the changing modalities, from focus applications that allow for moments of individual respite during a day of collaboration, to public spaces that promote circulation and destinations that attract social collisions. With a myriad of finish and textile options, Dual encourages personalization of these space typologies to create any mood desired.<br/><br/>Each chair is equipped with a return-to-center swivel. That subtle gesture can change a static setting into a dynamic space that keeps the conversation flowing and ensures that good ideas spread far and wide.<br/><br/>Dual introduces a residential aesthetic to create a welcoming environment for focus and recharge \u2013 so that work doesn\u2019t feel like work.",

In terms of formal design, it can be compared to the methods used in sculpture. Everything that is superfluous has been cut away to reveal the flowing contours of the body, the back, the armrests and the round seating surface on the inside. The result is a comparatively delicate, compact individual easy chair. Flint is rotatable and requires little space, while offering plenty of legroom and a high degree of seating comfort. With its formal separation, 'stern on the outside, soft on the inside', it works best as a soloist, but is still easily combinable. This idea can also be applied to the selection of the cover materials. Easy chairs and stools can be designed individually with contrasting colours and materials. The borderline between the inside and outside is emphasized by a circumferential seam. Cover materials: All fabrics and leathers from the COR Collection.",

They are semi-private living spaces which are built closely together to create a denser community, but also embracing the sense of privacy. One historical theory accredits their modular design to an elaborate form of tax evasion. The people of Alberobello were able to deconstruct their homes and collapse their settlements temporarily to hide from the high taxes imposed by nobility during and after the Medieval Era. With this narrative in mind, we designed our very own Trullo to be easy to assemble, move and replace promoting the longevity of use. Individual parts can be replaced easily and quickly to restore and repair the unit in the case of damage. <br/><br/> The Trullo features a fully upholstered, thick dual-panel structure to offer privacy and focus in any environment. This innovative design addresses the current need for design flexibility by providing a practical work space solution for the modern open-plan workplace. Companies are easily able to renovate, redesign and reconfigure their space without investing in construction. The spacious, enveloping back minimizes distractions and filters unwanted ambiance to create a secluded refuge. The series is complete with an array of customization options to make this chair as adaptable and versatile as the work space it joins. Among the versatile combination of high-quality textiles, fabrics, and features available are the integrated power / USB sockets. <br/><br/> A plethora of customization options make the Trullo highly adaptable and versatile. The Trullo inspires infinite design possibilities with three basic models: singular, double, and triple seat modules.These chairs can be configured to support individual work, collaborative spaces, and professional environments. Available in designer-inspired two-tone upholstery for maximum customization.

Kozmic can be arranged to accommodate architectural elements and style needs, as the design supports both linear and angular configurations.

Throughout each of these locations, they have experienced the difficulties of adapting furniture from one space to another, while preserving a sense of community and comfort. Readily available furniture options were consistently too visually heavy or not adaptable to certain spaces. They were never able to find the perfect fit. Neighborhood addresses this issue for adaptability by being a modular, mobile and connected design solution for the modern office.\u00a0<br/><br/>Airbnb celebrates the connections people make every day through their platform - connections with new places, new people, and cultures. Neighborhood celebrates the beauty of these connections while providing comfortable, flexible solutions for the evolving workplace.<br/><br/>Neighborhood\u2019s basic \"building block\" geometry provides endless configurations and adapts to any space. A series of high-back modules creates privacy and intimate (or hushed) seclusion within an open office, while a collection of benches and low-back seating units are perfect for casual conversations or creative brainstorming. Groupings can be readily rearranged to form expansive landscapes or small intimate settings. The highback version allows for open floor plans to appeal to the \u2018savanna preference\u2019 - a design principle that mimics the savanna\u2019s of our early ancestors. Technology integration and sound absorbing materials provide a smart option for workspaces. As companies grow and change, their furniture must also; Neighborhood reflects the fast-paced adaptation companies continually experience in a physical space.<br/><br/>Neighborhood is comprised of 42 unique modules, the largest collection ever released from Bernhardt Design, which range from tall privacy units to sofa sectionals and tables with electrical access to mobile ottomans. The range and flexibility of the line ensure that it\u2019s not only the perfect fit for office spaces but any public areas - from airports to restaurants.<br/><br/>Neighborhood typifies the exceptional quality and standards of Bernhardt Design. The surface options include wood, laminate, and solid surfaces. The collection may be specified in Bernhardt Textiles or COM.<br/><br/>Stitching and tailoring play an integral part in the appeal of Neighborhood. The contoured profile of the fully upholstered units is highlighted by distinctive jump stitch patterns around the perimeter. The beauty of the line is that it can be easily and instantly adaptable by the people using it, rather than relying on an installation team to reconfigure a workspace.<br/><br/>The idea of using two simple building blocks to create an entire community of flexible products results in a new generation of innovative design with seemingly unlimited possibilities. The mobile table units are fully power integrated to keep charged and plugged in while collaborating.<br/><br/>Neighborhood is GREENGUARD Certified. All adhesives are water-based.

The chair was developed for Geiger.<br/><br/>\u201cI wanted to design an incredibly comfortable chair that gives the personal fit of a custom-tailored suit, the support of the finest ergonomic chair, and the quality feel of a high-performance automobile seat,\u201d says Goetz.<br/><br/>Dr. Walker is a former competitive skier and a specialist in design for human performance. His proprietary MEARS technology was developed to identify what the human body needs to be strong and comfortable, and then help a designer translate those needs into design requirements for seating that empowers the person sitting in the chair.<br/><br/>Every contour of Taper has a purpose. The complex contouring of the upholstered backrest focuses support in areas of the back that are important for musculoskeletal balance: the sacrum, or base of the spine, and the transition between the lumbar and thoracic spine. <br/><br/>By supporting these key areas, the chair\u2019s backrest design encourages seated individuals to assume a more powerful seated posture: hips rotated forward, spine curved in a natural S-shape, chest open, shoulders back. <br/><br/>The seat of the Taper Chair uses an innovative suspension construction that adapts to the pelvis, so a person feels comfortably supported from the moment they sit down. While executive chairs traditionally feature padding, Goetz took Taper in the opposite direction. \u201cThe closer that we get to the human body and the needs of the human body, the less material we need to use,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole way we achieved comfort in this chair is to get very close to the human body, to the point where you can actually see evidence of where your body belongs,\u201d in the chair. <br/><br/>The chair\u2019s tilt\u2014a modified version of Herman Miller\u2019s most advanced tilt mechanism\u2014delivers a balanced, controlled ride throughout the chair\u2019s full range of recline.<br/><br/>It\u2019s this seamless merger of design for human performance with Geiger\u2019s core strength in quality construction and craft that makes the Taper Chair truly unique among executive chairs.",

            "description_html": "Neither a car seat nor a pure piece of furniture or design. It is a contemporary hybrid that brings together two brands, two imaginations, two industrial philosophies to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Maranello carmaker. A new object that perfectly translates a dream into reality. This is an office chair that captures the excitement, speed and dynamism of the driver\u2019s seat, as well as the passion for racing. And that transmits a pleasant sensation of how the backrest and seat support movements and posture. A blend of automotive know-how and the culture of living.<br/>Conceived and designed by the Ferrari Design team directed by Flavio Manzoni, which designed the recent Ferrari models (including the LaFerrari Aperta, the GTC4Lusso and the 812 Superfast) , its iconic profile launches itself into the space enveloping its body. <br/>The Cockpit is a place where concentration, quick reflexes and intuition join with a will to win. It is a space where the driver comes into contact with their car, assumes the correct driving position on the seat and drives the vehicle around corners. The contact between the body and the seat creates dynamic sensations that help the driver to control the car as efficiently as possible. For the moment two versions are available, the President and the Executive. Both comprise a reclining base and seat, integrated with two different backrests. The President is the managerial model with a high backrest that offers generous support for the top half of the body and which is inspired by the ergonomics of competitive racing seats. The Executive model, a chair that adapts to all work contexts, has a deliberately low and narrow backrest to ensure freedom of movement. The central band on the seat takes its cue from racing seats. The materials are the same as those used in Ferrari cars. The external shell is moulded from carbon or alutex. Poltrona Frau has concentrated the very highest ergonomic knowhow in the mechanism used to adjust the position of the backrest and the height of the seat. The swivel device sports the same design and mechanical elements as the steering wheel, the 5-spoke base comes in the two polished or powder-coated aluminium finishes in matt racing grey. For the leather upholstery, the Ferrari Design Centre team has chosen shades and finishes inspired by the trim of the three Tailor-Made service lines, which allow for the customised configuration of the car: Scuderia, Classica and Inedita. Cockpit can also be customised in terms of its colours and materials.",

This attractive, lightweight series incorporates a high level of engineering to enhance the user experience and adapt to the evolving modern workspace. This intelligent seating line was designed to address the growing importance and value of designing professional workspaces that enhance comfort, health, and individual well being. <br/><br/> Adapting to the new trends in office interior design, this seating line appeals to any modern workspace. Advancing technology has produced smaller, faster devices allow for a smaller footprint for electronics per workstation.

As the desire for assigned workspace fades, the need for adjustability and flexibility is increasing. The IC2 recognizes and addresses this growing demand by providing an infinite number of configurations and adjustments. The durable 4D armrests are height and width-adjustable with lockable swivel and arm-pad adjustment. The contoured polyurethane lumbar support pad can be easily adjusted up/down and in/out for personalized comfort and ergonomic back support. The optional headrest pivots in/out and adjusts up/down on a contoured axis. The IC2 can accommodate the diverse workforce regardless of size, posture or work requirements with a plethora of options, configurations, and adjustments.<br/><br/> Achieving new levels of balance, flexibility, and performance through ergonomic innovations that provide total back support and respond to every movement.

Taking approximately 40 hours to complete from start to finish, the result in a one-of-a-kind accent chair built to last for generations. <br/><br/>An homage to the wisdom and inventiveness of traditional American design, the Wayland Snake Armchair is inspired by the form and silhouette of the classic early American-Windsor chair. This style, which originated in the 18th century, emerged as a simplified and visually lighter interpretation of the British Windsor chair \u2013 American craftsmen eliminated its extraneous details, and slenderized the splats and legs for a more delicate, airy appearance. <br/><br/>O&amp;G\u2019s Wayland Snake Armchair shares the same characteristics -- featuring a spindled back uninterrupted by a central splat, slim proportions, and a streamlined silhouette, the piece can be described as a continuation of the American-Windsor\u2019s legacy. It also features a \u201ccontinuous arm,\u201d in which a chair\u2019s arms and back rim are made of a single, bent piece of wood. This development also arose with the birth of the American-Windsor, strengthening the chair while also giving it a lighter, more balanced look. In addition, O&amp;G\u2019s Wayland Snake Armchair also draws from the American-Windsor\u2019s legacy of hand-craftsmanship, with continuous, hand-carved arms and a hand-shaped saddle seat.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the snake motif of O&amp;G\u2019s chair pays tribute to another part of traditional American design, American folk art. Animals were a favorite subject for naturalistic and allegorical carvings during the 18th and 19th centuries, and were frequently incorporated into walking sticks and sculpture. This was in part due to the prevalence of nature in day-to-day life during this time, but also the influence of Native American design traditions and their frequent incorporation of animal motifs. Consequently, the hand-carved snake motif of O&amp;G\u2019s Wayland chair is not only a preservation of this rich legacy, but also modernizes the piece with exquisite detailing that would have been viewed as too time-consuming and therefore, unnecessary, by early American-Windsor craftsmen.<br/><br/>O&amp;G\u2019s Wayland Snake Armchair is made by local artisans at the studio\u2019s headquarters in Warren, Rhode Island, and is available in their Ebony, Beet, or Azimuth stained finishes. <br/><br/>The Wayland Snake Armchair is a synthesis of two incredibly important and influential American design traditions \u2013 when fused together, the result is distinctly contemporary, without sacrificing either\u2019s historical significance or defining characteristics. From a larger perspective, this idea of keeping the traditions American design alive by updating them for modern day is a hallmark O&amp;G Studio\u2019s approach towards design as a whole, and why their pieces are not just aesthetically beautiful, but historically and culturally significant as well.",

The Eddy armchair is built using the same logic as bicycle construction, around a tubular metal frame, while the seat is designed to be comfortable and ergonomic. The way in which the various parts of the frame are connected - using \u201cquick release\u201d fittings - is an obvious reference to the cycling world.<br/>The use of separate elements to make up the frame of the armchair makes it possible to play with the graphics and thus create multiple combinations of different colours and finishes. The armrests can be embellished with side pockets which are useful for storing books and magazines or to keep remote controls within easy reach.

The leather elements in the Mandarin series are shaped in gentle curving lines; they can be said to have roots in the mid-century experimentations with molded plywood that are a cornerstone of Modern furniture.

The result is an incredible integration of tones, textures and patterns, traditionally found in indoor products, designed to be used out in the open. <br/><br/>The inspiration for such idea came about when Patricia Urquiola\u00a0travelled to India. There, she became captivated by the delicacy and harmony of Mughal architecture. Gardens, terraces and miniatures found their way into her restless imagination inspiring a new collection, which from the very first moment she wanted to be ambivalent, suitable for outdoor and indoor.<br/><br/>On sand, or lawns, carpeting over a deck or just bringing an element of comfort to low benches, GARDEN LAYERS adds an extra touch of well-being and refinement, inspired by the long Eastern tradition of lounging in open air spaces. The collection can be used for relaxation or sun bathing beside a pool, at the beach or at home. Also perfect to use under shade, GARDEN LAYERS is a space of relaxation, of conversation in porches or under pergolas, given its adaptability to warm environments as well as other more moderate climates. It is made with particularly resistant high-tech fabric and quick-dry foam fillings, so it doesn\u2019t require any additional maintenance.<br/><br/>GARDEN LAYERS is based on a modular system that allows users to create infinite compositions according to the needs and the layout of their spaces. Rugs, mattresses, roll pillows and cushions, all available in different sizes and three colour groups, can be arranged in an infinite number of ways: extensive compositions or more intimate arrangements, rectangular or asymmetrical. The mattresses can be laid over one or more rugs, the cushions are supported on the roll pillows, in this way spaces can be constructed for the purpose of reclining and relaxing, to create socialising areas or define separate zones.<br/><br/>Patricia Urquiola\u2019s imagination and her masterly creativity is illustrated in these warm and welcoming spaces.

With an obsession for perfection and a lot of love, we promise to continue the tradition of craft by making high-end objects more accessible and useful for people's everyday life. The Stemn Series is Fyrn's debut line and the foundation for a broader furniture system that aims to change the way people relate to and value the objects they choose for their homes, hopefully, inspiring a move away from disposable culture.<br/><br/>Stemn emphasizes the strength of metal and the warmth of wood. In designing the line and the manufacturing process Fyrn's founder, Ros Broughton, relied upon his family's rich history of craftsmanship and his own 25+ years of building and furniture making expertise to develop proprietary hardware and manufacturing equipment that would make production feasible and scalable in San Francisco.<br/><br/>The secret to the Stemn Series is courtesy of the sculptural Stemn bracket (patented and made by Fyrn). Sturdy, replaceable and uncomplicated, it is a truly beautiful piece of exposed hardware that enables strong, high-end furniture that can ship flat and assemble at home without sacrificing an iota of grace or durability. All chairs and stools are also available fully assembled and are customizable by the wood finish, bracket color, and upholstery making them versatile enough to fit a multitude of design environments.<br/><br/>Fyrn developed the entire Stemn package experience in-house, with a focus on making home assembly as intuitive and satisfying as the product itself. Talented San Francisco artists Mik Gaspay and Chris McNally created the art on the exterior and interior of the shipper boxes and screen printed many of the internal materials by hand. Fyrn's own design and engineering of the 3 packaging trays break the assembly experience into simple stages that allow for the elimination of an instruction pamphlet or booklet. The internal toolkit includes a phone stand constructed from scrap material salvaged during the Stemn production process, a \"Fyrn tool\" or torque wrench that clicks when each screw is properly tightened, and extra screws if needed. The toolkit is constructed to be retained and will fit nicely on a bookshelf if ever needed for future maintenance.<br/><br/>Stemn focuses on sustainable choices from design through delivery. Responsibly harvested lumber, minimizing transit, and using recyclable packaging is a given. But, Fyrn believes the most sustainable path is to produce a product that will last a lifetime. Durability combined with an easily repairable system is the true strength of Stemn and what will make these chairs and stools future heirlooms.",

A family of dynamic elements which \u2013 through its generous volumes \u2013 evokes a classical element, comfort, deriving from in-depth research aimed at achieving the best possible balance between cushion thickness and softness; the careful study of the ratio between elastic belts and the inner gaps in the foam give the seat and backrest cushions the optimum flexibility, without sacrificing their asymmetrical features.

The backrest and armrest cushions are embellished with a padded trim that runs around the edges. Every element is equipped with a foot, which emerges where the backrest meets the armrest. There is also a series of optional cushions in two different sizes (40x50 cm and 50x60 cm) with down padding and upholstery with a special band whose padded trim matches the motif around the edges of the armrest and backrest cushions.",

With an obsession for perfection and a lot of love, we promise to continue the tradition of craft by making high-end objects more accessible and useful for people's everyday life. The Stemn Series is Fyrn's debut line and the foundation for a broader furniture system that aims to change the way people relate to and value the objects they choose for their homes, hopefully, inspiring a move away from disposable culture.<br/><br/>Stemn emphasizes the strength of metal and the warmth of wood. In designing the line and the manufacturing process Fyrn's founder, Ros Broughton, relied upon his family's rich history of craftsmanship and his own 25+ years of building and furniture making expertise to develop proprietary hardware and manufacturing equipment that would make production feasible and scalable in San Francisco.<br/><br/>The secret to the Stemn Series is courtesy of the sculptural Stemn bracket (patented and made by Fyrn). Sturdy, replaceable and uncomplicated, it is a truly beautiful piece of exposed hardware that enables strong, high-end furniture that can ship flat and assemble at home without sacrificing an iota of grace or durability. All chairs and stools are also available fully assembled and are customizable by the wood finish, bracket color, and upholstery making them versatile enough to fit a multitude of design environments.<br/><br/>Fyrn developed the entire Stemn package experience in-house, with a focus on making home assembly as intuitive and satisfying as the product itself. Talented San Francisco artists Mik Gaspay and Chris McNally created the art on the exterior and interior of the shipper boxes and screen printed many of the internal materials by hand. Fyrn's own design and engineering of the 3 packaging trays break the assembly experience into simple stages that allow for the elimination of an instruction pamphlet or booklet. The internal toolkit includes a phone stand constructed from scrap material salvaged during the Stemn production process, a \"Fyrn tool\" or torque wrench that clicks when each screw is properly tightened, and extra screws if needed. The toolkit is constructed to be retained and will fit nicely on a bookshelf if ever needed for future maintenance.<br/><br/>Stemn focuses on sustainable choices from design through delivery. Responsibly harvested lumber, minimizing transit, and using recyclable packaging is a given. But, Fyrn believes the most sustainable path is to produce a product that will last a lifetime. Durability combined with an easily repairable system is the true strength of Stemn and what will make these chairs and stools future heirlooms.",

It is finished with a three step coating (dye, base coat and top coat) highly resistant to solar radiation thanks to UV filters. Multliple options are available for the seat upholstery: natural and faux leather, pure virgin wool fabric, velvet and polypropylene. <br/>This updated version of the historic stool turns it into an essential piece and emphasizes the everlasting validity of a particular design method, one standing aside from fashion trends and the conventions of a specific era.

Co-designed by architect Sir David Adjaye, designer of the latest Smithsonian Museum \u2013 the National Museum of African American History and Culture \u2013 the MA770 Wireless Speaker\u2019s use of premium materials and components can be found throughout.<br/><br/>Comprised of a proprietary concrete composite \u2013 the result of Master &amp; Dynamic\u2019s passion for innovation with a variety of materials \u2013 the MA770\u2019s core material provides a number of acoustic benefits such as increased dampening, reduced resonance from the enclosure due to its single-mold build, a purer sound and added durability. The dampening properties of the concrete are so impressive \u2013 five times better than wood and ten times better than plastic \u2013 that the speaker can be placed just inches away from a turntable and play at full volume without causing the record to skip.<br/><br/>The MA770\u2019s sonic sophistication also stems from its dual 4\u201d woven kevlar long throw woofers and 1 \u00bd\u201d titanium tweeter powered by 100 watts of Class D amplification. The use of two smaller long throw kevlar woofers allows the MA770\u2019s drivers to react incredibly quickly, accurately delivering the punch and energy of the original artistry; the rigidity of the proprietary titanium tweeter also aides the speaker in delivering crystal clear sound. Tuning the MA770\u2019s sound profile was achieved with a laser doppler anemometer and hundreds of hours of listening to achieve harmony between the custom drivers and concrete enclosure.<br/><br/>The speaker's controls are crafted in diamond-cut anodized aluminum, while a magnetically-attached etched stainless steel grille serves to protect the speaker\u2019s componentry. The grille is removable for those that prefer the chic look of the exposed components to the grille\u2019s elegance. The speaker surprises and delights with sloping fine edges and triangular shapes that end with a gentle point on the speaker's unique back.<br/><br/>The MA770 can be controlled by four source options: Chromecast built-in, Bluetooth, analog (3.5mm) and optical. The MA770 can be used as a single stereo unit or paired with another speaker via Wi-Fi to provide a larger stereo image, enabling multi-room audio via Chromecast built-in. It is the first speaker to use this technology for stereo pairing. <br/><br/>Designed in New York City, the MA770 Wireless Speaker is created by pouring a proprietary concrete composite into a single-mold casing and allowing it to cure. The case is then hand-polished, giving each MA770 its own unique look. Once the outer case is complete, the speaker\u2019s various componentry is meticulously placed into the concrete casing via a discrete port located on the product\u2019s underbelly. Once sealed inside the single-mold concrete composite casing, the speaker is ready for use.<br/><br/>At 16in x 20in x 10in and 35lbs, the speaker is capable of filling a large room with sonically sophisticated sound, while its polished exterior is perfect for use in the home, office, gallery, or museum.",

It is the epitome of designing with nature with white flecks, created by the flax content, scattering across the surface of the fabric just as the flowers would appear in the fields from which it is grown. <br/>The true definition of Patina is a coating or film on a surface that has built up over time, like rust that develops on metal. For this fabric Camira has expanded the definition to cover all pattern in nature around us. <br/><br/>Patina is inspired by Camira\u2019s trend forecast, Evolution: Global Trend Directions 2017/18, specifically a trend called Habitat which explores human impact and the wellbeing of all things in our environment. Using the colors, patterns and textures that nature\u2019s different temperaments reveal and combining this with the skills, design and insight of man, Camira has developed a fabric which demonstrates the result of these two environments working together. <br/><br/>Camira\u2019s designer of Patina, Hayley Barrett, commented: \u201cOnly by taking a deep breath and slowing down do we become aware of our surroundings and the Pattern in Nature is revealed to us. This is the overarching theme behind the development of Patina \u2013 having the ability to take in the beauty of the natural environment, stepping outside and using this to promote thought and new ideas. <br/><br/>\u201cWhen developing the aesthetics of this fabric, we were keen to celebrate the natural beauty of flax and let it shine through. As well as look of the fabric, the inclusion of flax harnesses its natural ability to meet the higher level flammability standards without any chemical post treatment.\u201d<br/><br/>Available in a charming palette of 43 colorways, Patina captures the landscape around us as well as featuring nourishing new shades to complement the wider Camira portfolio. Patina marks the ongoing evolution of Camira's bast fiber family of fabrics made from wool, nettle, hemp and flax.<br/><br/>Composition: 69% Wool, 22% Flax, 8% Polyamide, 1% Viscose<br/><br/>Abrasion: Patina meets heavy duty abrasion achieving \u2265100,000 Martindale cycles.",

            "description_html": "Eastern Hemisphere is the latest Luum Textiles collection designed by Suzanne Tick, inspired by her summer travels to the Tibetan Plateau region with grassland nomads and fellow weavers. Interpretations of the slow and spiritual approach to life, along with the beauty of rocky textures and traditional geometric patterns, are captured in this collection of four new fabrics. <br/><br/>The complexity of the Tibetan culture is embodied in the collection\u2019s rich colors and textures. The nuances of handmade materials bring a contemplative aesthetic into the modern environment.<br/><br/>As well-being becomes an essential design objective, we continue to value the nuances of the natural and the handmade. The Eastern Hemisphere collection expresses these attributes while fulfilling the need for textural elements in today\u2019s interior spaces. The collection is made up of four products: Thangka, an upholstery fabric; Ghat, a multi-purpose fabric; Dhurga, a direct glue wallcovering; and Monotex, an upholstery fabric. <br/><br/>Thangka is a large-scale weathered geometric inspired by the Buddhist mandalas or sacred diagrams of Tibet. The subtle patterning explores straight angles and half circles on a chenille ground, evoking tradition with a contemporary feel. This nimble pattern perfectly complements today\u2019s trend of rounded design elements and curvilinear furniture. The palette embodies bright colors found in sacred Tibetan artwork as well as the region\u2019s natural surroundings. Thangka utilizes a bleach-cleanable, core-lock polyester chenille yarn paired with a bright polyester.<br/><br/>Ghat is an irregular textural pattern that alludes to the pebbly landscapes of Tibet and the natural hand-spun yarns of the area. The multi-purpose pattern offers a distinct, perceived texture and can be used as both upholstery or wrapped wall. The blend of polyester, wool and nylon yarns utilized in this construction adds surface interest to the textural patterning. <br/><br/>Dhurga is a textural, patterned, direct-glue wallcovering inspired by the rocky Tibetan landscapes. Utilizing the same pattern as Ghat, this construction features a subtly striated yarn in the ground countered by a lustrous yarn that activates the organically patterned surface. Dhurga brings a natural material sensibility to our wallcovering offering by providing a soft textural look to vertical interior surfaces. <br/><br/>Monotex is a printed, bleach-cleanable polyurethane that takes its pattern directly from a textural woven fabric. Monotex captures the visual softness of irregular hand-spun yarn fabrics while offering the desired performance attributes inherent to a coated fabric. Monotex\u2019s versatile and broad color palette is an ideal solution to meet the needs of a wide variety of market segments.",

The Foundation Collection visually reveals the patience, foresight, and physical strength of the human spirit to bring these projects to fruition, which in some cases spanned centuries and were fraught with setbacks before completion.<br/><br/>The Foundation Collection pays homage to craft and process. The textiles and vinyl wallcovering in the collection reveal a universal design language that ties each pattern together giving designers the ability to coordinate the collection beautifully and cohesively within a space. Though rooted in history, these innovative pattern interpretations come across as quite modern in both design and color selection and deliver a vast array of contemporary materials with a fresh perspective and a timeless feel.<br/><br/>The textile patterns in the Foundation Collection are a combination of solution dyed nylon and polyester and were tested to 100,000 double rubs on the Wyzenbeek. They are stocked with the INCASE stain protection, are bleach cleanable at a 20%/80% bleach to water ratio, and are manufactured in the USA.

Examples of stitching, patching, and layering are mending techniques that can be found throughout the history of textiles. The \"Stitch\" Collection takes its inspiration from the tradition of repairing and renewal. This assortment of healthcare centric upholstery and privacy curtain fabrics celebrates the resiliency and restorative qualities of the human spirit. Each of Noonan's designs was inspired by an original textile artifact. The pattern designs in the Stitch Collection are characterized by the use of linear elements (connection), texture (touch), and textile heritage (history). The constructions were engineered to create an artisanal look and feel that emulate the handmade textile references. The collection consists of six seating fabrics: Darning, Crazy Quilt, Kantha, Running Stitch, Saori and Boro; along with two privacy curtain fabrics: Friendship Quilt and Embellished. Proceeds from sales that result from the collaboration will be donated to the Common Thread for the Cure Foundation's Helping Hand Grants program to support those persons or their families within our industry who have breast cancer. It can be used to meet financial obligations, household needs, transportation to doctor\u2019s appointments, etc. The collection will feature C-Zero Plus Moisture Barrier, Crypton's non-fluorinated performance option.",

            "description_html": "The Arc-Com Design Studio proudly introduces its new Tintura Collection. A coordinated group of three, patterns Raya, Elevado, and Linea find their inspiration in the ancient art of Guatemalan backstrap weaving and dyeing. <br/><br/>Backstrap weaving has been practiced in many different parts of the world for centuries. Today, it is still used in many parts of Guatemala by Mayan women who use the technique to weave fabric for clothing, shawls, tablecloths, towels, and more.<br/><br/>Backstrap weaving is traditionally prepared on a simple loom comprised of six to seven rods. These looms are usually made by the weavers and the width of the fabric is determined by the width of the rod. The warp threads are strung onto a back rod which is then tied to a tree or a post. The other end of the loom has a strap that encircles the weaver\u2019s waist. The proper tension of the loom is created by the positioning of the weaver\u2019s body. Typically the backstrap weaver sits on the ground and moves forward or backward to produce the necessary tension. The process is quite physical and the blouses or \u201chuipils\u201d created by the Mayan women are considered very special because their bodies are intimately engaged in every movement of their creation. The backstrap loom is mobile and is simply untied and rolled up whenever the weaver has finished. <br/><br/>Historically, Guatemalan women wove with cotton yarns that were hand dyed with natural plant dyes. They would use plants, fruits, insects, and vegetables such as hibiscus flowers, carrots, coconut shells, avocado tree bark, and achiote, to produce beautiful brightly colored fibers for weaving. The literal translation for the Spanish word tintura is dyeing, and the gloriously rich and vibrant color palette for the Tintura Collection was inspired by these ancient dyeing methods. <br/><br/><br/>Arc-Com\u2019s Tintura Collection is an in depth study of weave, color, and fiber inspired by Guatemalan textiles and the processes used to create them. Although this collection is commercially woven of 100% polyester and dyed to adhere to current contract performance standards, the Arc-Com Design Team sought to source yarns, explore modern weaving techniques, and discover colors that would capture the beauty and aesthetic of these time honored backstrap weaving and hand dyeing techniques. <br/><br/>Pattern Raya (Spanish for stripe) offers a chunky, large scale, multicolored stripe with a hand-woven appeal. Stocked in 13 colors, Raya is the patterned item in the collection.<br/><br/>Pattern Linea (Spanish for line) provides a small scale, linear, textured coordinate to pattern Raya but can be used as a standalone textile with tremendous surface interest. Linea comes in 13 colorways.<br/><br/>Pattern Elevado (Spanish for raised) offers a dynamic, raised surface, coordinated plain. Elevado comes in 20 vibrant, solid colorways.<br/><br/>All three patterns in the Tintura Collection have been tested to 100,000 double rubs and are stocked with a stain resistant and backing.",

The ground is woven with a special boucl\u00e9 yarn, updating this classic motif. The pattern is non-directional which makes it versatile anywhere.<br/><br/>Named for an exotic animal preserve, Shambala is an upbeat and playful take on a leopard pattern that is easy on the eyes. The mix of colorful weaves is softened by textures.<br/><br/>Soft and luxurious Talisman is an allover diamond pattern that can be used anywhere. It is simple enough for large upholstery and special enough for a dining room chair. The tone-on-tone chenille yarn gives this fabric a nice, supple hand.<br/><br/>Windsong is a multi-colored texture with a visible weave effect that offers just the right amount of interest and dimension. The heathered yarn is reminiscent of a handwoven raffia.<br/><br/>Inspired by our Danube Ikat wallpaper, Danube Ikat Stripe is a soft woven fabric that pairs nicely with other patterns in the Oasis collection. Vertical breaks in the ikat give it a handmade look.<br/><br/>Delray Diamond is a simple, large-scale 3-color pattern that emulates a dyed textile. The perfectly sized layout is ideal for pillows or cushions.<br/><br/>Linea Chevron is a mid-size chevron pattern which mixes varying shades of one color and white to give a softened graphic effect.<br/><br/>Trinidad makes use of a new Sunbrella yarn that is evocative of a natural fiber. The detailed concentric diamonds make for an especially beautiful interior upholstery fabric.<br/><br/>An impressionistic moire or woodgrain pattern, Soundwave has been softened to give the fabric that luxurious hand. Although it has a large repeat, it makes a subtle statement with its tone-on-tone coloring.<br/><br/>Like finding a treasure on a beach, Beachcomber is a simple chenille with a horizontal texture. This densely woven plain was designed for use on a whole outdoor setting or as a basecloth for interior sofas and sectionals.<br/><br/>Parquet is a graphic geometric that brings to mind decorative wooden floors or unique tiling patterns. Look closely and you will see this pattern creates a vertical stripe effect. This fabric has an interesting mix of raised boucl\u00e9 yarn with a flat weave.<br/><br/>An addition to Thibaut\u2019s other Sunbrella sheer offerings, Windswept is a simple variegated vertical stripe. It can be used inside or outside to soften light.<br/><br/>Fabrics in the Oasis collection can withstand intense light, so while they are great for poolsides and terraces, they can also be used in indoor spaces like sun-filled porches and window seats.

The collection tells the story of what lies beneath the product to connect consumers to the fabric, from the yarn to the finished piece.<br/><br/>Fabrics in Makers incorporate the performance qualities of Sunbrella with authentic designs tied to generations of makers. The collection portrays the importance of preserving the conventional element of craft while advancing technologically. By combining new, experimental techniques with traditional style, the artisan fabrics are perfectly suited for both indoor and outdoor upholstery.<br/><br/>Exemplifying Sunbrella design innovation and technological advancements, jacquard pattern Adaption juxtaposes matte and shiny with PVC yarn. The pattern is reminiscent of hand-forged metal designs with a simple geometric pattern in tonal colors.<br/><br/>Midori is inspired by traditional Japanese Shibori dyeing. A process which involves folding, twisting or bunching fabric, binding it and then dyeing it, Shibori dyeing creates one-of-a-kind pieces, in which no pattern is the same. The Sunbrella design team recreated this look with modern weaving equipment, making the fabric look more primitive and handmade, while preserving Sunbrellla\u2019s legendary performance.<br/><br/>A traditional menswear-inspired pattern, Paradigm pairs well with the contemporary patterns throughout the collection. Makers nurtures an inclusive community of makers, challenging them to create extraordinary spaces with the fabrics.<br/><br/>In addition to jacquard patterns, the collection adds new stripes and expands colorways for some of the company\u2019s most trusted solids. A standout among the new stripe patterns is Artistry. Inspired by Mayan backstrap weaving, this fabric represents the custom woven pattern of vintage textiles. A new texture, Blend, is made of a heavier yarn for a soft, textured hand in a wide range of colors.<br/><br/>With dedication to the smallest details, the collection is rooted in a deep connection to a community of makers, like those on the Sunbrella design team. With a combined 145 years of experience in textile design, these makers live and breathe design. They collect inspiration from many different sources including travel, personal experiences, art and other forms of craft, weaving these inspirations into their textile designs.<br/><br/>The Makers Collection of Sunbrella fabrics is currently available to the manufacturing trade and will be at retail this fall.

The collection houses a compendium of unique, documentary-inspired patterns and a series of 21st century designs employing innovative appliqu\u00e9, velvet and hand-knotting techniques. <br/><br/>Oberon honors the aesthetic of traditional grandeur in the fine detailing of its borders, intricate gimp, various beaded fringes and tassel tiebacks. Offered in six hues of metal, the collection is composed of a 1.25\u201d Oberon Beaded Fringe, a 2\u201d Oberon Teardrop Beaded Fringe and an elaborate 4\u201d Triple Beaded Fringe. In addition to the Oberon 2\u201d Tassel Fringe, there are 4.75\u201d and 8.25\u201d Bullion Fringes. Complementing the fringes are both woven and twisted cords which transcend time and are suitable in both traditional and contemporary applications.<br/><br/>The Oberon Crete is an open weave created through a series of concentric circles of guiperes, while the Oberon Braid\u2019s small cords form a geometric ogee pattern that glides across its finely woven ribbed ground. An intricate \u00bd\u201d Oberon Gimp and a lush 1\u201d Oberon Brush Fringe complete this assortment.<br/><br/>The Oberon Double Tassel Tieback and Key Tassel have sleek bullion skirts and finely wrapped tapered molds with an overlay of hand-tied netting that have been loomed with the finest denier metal yarns. A complementary Oberon Rosette completes this ensemble. Among the signature pieces in the collection is the Oberon Double Quilles Tieback which features an ornate series of round and tapered molds with overlays of finely knotted netting. <br/><br/>The pattern of hand-tied satin knots in the Constellation Border is derived from an abstraction of star positions in the night sky. The Mercury and Eclipse Borders, though minimalist in character, have surfaces that appear to have been gilded in silver and gold. The Luna Border employs a sumptuous texture in its dense cut pile velvet which is then enhanced with fine metallic embroidery. The Solar Border is an abstract hand-blocked print with embroidered metallic silhouettes. The extraordinarily sculptural character of the Orbit Border is created through a series of laser cut, matte metallic oval foils with hollowed centers that are appliqu\u00e9d to a finely woven twill border. The ovals create the illusion of something otherworldly as they seem to hover effortlessly above the border\u2019s surface. Saturn\u2019s rings are portrayed in its namesake Saturn Striped Border as individually-spun metal cords stripe across its ground. <br/><br/>The Oberon Collection exudes luxury in the realm of traditional grandeur and exquisite detailing while at the same time using the minimalist simplicity of fine metal thread to articulate the most innovative contemporary borders. The ethereal natural of the materials used in this collection and versatility in interpretation make this an exquisite part of any designer\u2019s library.",

Those qualities are also at the core of the Sunbrella brand as a pioneer and leader in the textile industry.<br/><br/>The collection is comprised of 53 fabrics and is grounded by five hero patterns: Lahaina Wave, Eagle Rock, Canyon Lands, Zapotec and Mountain Majesty. The hero patterns are supported by a range of textural solids and coordinating patterns.<br/><br/>Lahaina Wave combines traditional tribal-influenced designs from the Hawaiian mainland with blue and turquoise representing the waves of the beaches near Lahaina, Maui. Outlined in a sawtooth design, the pattern evokes the power and challenges of the surf.<br/><br/>Named after a mountain summit in Apache County, Arizona, Eagle Rock incorporates Native American design elements and weaving traditions of the Southwest. The pattern features a defined center element highlighted against a solid background and reflected side motifs on a striped ground, exhibiting an artful sense of movement.<br/><br/>Inspired by Utah\u2019s tall pinnacles of rock that form breathtaking vistas along the skyline, Canyon Lands uses a modern ombr\u00e9 weave to create rich layers that mimic the movement of sunlight dancing across the canyons.<br/><br/>Zapotec gets its name from the Zapotec Indians of Oaxaca, Mexico, who established a tradition of weaving colorful cloths using natural dyes from plants and animals. The pattern features classic geometric designs and elegant simplicity.<br/><br/>Symbols derived from Navajo Native Americans are complemented by quiet colors that evoke the evening light in Mountain Majesty.

Our internal design team has worked on those patterns for 3 years to achieve the layered looks that are on this collection (as collections came out the technical know-how in relief and layers increased). Those patterns explore natural textures and seek to replicate random patterns that can be found either in handcrafted materials or in the wilderness. <br/><br/>The patterns:<br/><br/>Cascade: evoking petals cascading down a wall, this round pattern has a soothing effect. In three neutral colors (off white, light grey and black) it plays interestingly with light and shadows thanks to its plushness. Straight match 45'', 49'' wide<br/><br/>Vibrato: honeycombs, ancient crafts or pointillism, this pattern speaks to everyone differently. The imperfect hexagonal geometry brings interest and structure to the textured dot pattern. Pattern available in 4 colors, bright white, orange, army green or slate. Straight match 35'', 49'' wide<br/><br/>Touch: a very tough pattern to pull off given the amount of details involved, Touch brings chunky knits to walls. As its name indicates, it also brings up an irrepressible urge to feel its texture. Three neutrals (off white, grey and black) plus a bright green make up the colorways. Free match, 49'' wide<br/><br/>Wood: Sanded planks of wood come to life, where the grain of the virtual wood brings a modern yet rugged depth and warmth. Wood is available in 4 neutral colors (off-white, light grey, dark grey and black), and is a free match, 49'' wide<br/><br/>Aside of their aestetics, all of these products have strong acoustic advantages and have been tested accordingly: alphaW=0.20(H) performed according to ISO 354 and evaluated according to ISO 11654<br/>They have also received an A+ grade regarding indoor air emissions.

The line is comprised of three patterns: <br/><br/>1) Petticoat Palm: A dynamic palm print made in memory of the tenacious Cuban women who have influenced the designer's life. <br/><br/>2) Fauna Fantas\u00eda: A jungle print, designed for a story told by the designer's grandfather, illustrating the unusual fact that there are no deadly poisonous animals on Cuba's shores.<br/><br/>3) Santos Suarez: Named after the neighborhood the designer's mother grew up in, this trellis is evocative of Havana's interiors, as well as a symbol of the separation between Cubans who fled and those who remained behind. <br/><br/>Grow House Grow's wallpapers are hand silk-screened with care in NY state. Known for their narrative inspiration, each wallpaper has its own tale to tell.

Rather than print the patterns digitally, we aim to push the boundaries of what is possible in screenprinted wallpaper. After creating the initial design in the studio and establishing the color palette, we work to see how much of the details and pleasant imperfections can be brought out during the creation of the screens and printing process. The idea is that the combination of hand-drawn patterns, delicate line work, textured brush strokes and the imperfection of the handmade results in a wallpaper that brings a sense of intimacy through simplicity to a residential or commercial space. \u00a0<br/><br/>Kim started a daily drawing practice to simply appreciate the things around her, and now our studio work comes from a practice of storytelling through drawing. We are interested in the connection of everyday things with the broader experience of society and life. One of our primary interests is in home and community and how we navigate the public and private worlds. We believe decorative objects are an important tool for communicating how we as a society believe things are organized and should be celebrated. Places we travel, food we eat or things in our home all become content for the drawings we make which eventually become the wallpaper our studio handprints. Connecting to a place through drawing the objects in it and collecting them into a group on the wall, allows viewers to connect to the everyday things around them in new ways. Developing this emotional connection is integral to our process and working with objects in the home or in specific locations is an exciting challenge to find and expose the stories that have always existed.",

The patterns in the collection are united by their glyphic, graphic qualities: gestural, non-fussy abstractions of such varied inspirations as handwriting, a star-lit sky or masonry wall.\u201d<br/><br/>Thatcher\u2019s signature impact and surprise comes from the collision of humble line drawings with her deluxe metallic inks. The glossy gold, gunmetal and diamond finishes add a layer of elegance to the understated imagery.<br/><br/>Four patterns in a total of fifteen colorways:<br/><br/>Bomba: improvisational composition of lively scribbles, dashes, zig zags, waves, and scrawling lines. Thatcher took her cues from handwritten signatures, the ultimate individual mark-making. Five two-tone metallic colorways: Gold on Cream, Gold on Charcoal, Diamonds and Pearls on Cream, Gunmetal on Navy, Gunmetal on Blush, Gunmetal on Cream.<br/><br/>The Pearl: eccentrically-drawn and arrayed shapes abstract a stone mason\u2019s hand-constructed wall. Four two-tone metallic colorways: Gold on Cream, Gold on Charcoal, Diamonds and Pearls on Cream, Gunmetal on Blush. <br/><br/>Pavlova: delicate overlapping curves, arcs and bends. Named for the Russian ballerina, famous for her sylphlike appearance, grace of movement and expressive nature. Three duo-tone metallic colorways: Gunmetal on Cream, Diamonds and Pearls on Cream, Gold on Cream. <br/><br/>Dusk: minutely-scaled squares and rectangles imprecisely scattered; they appear animated, as sparkling stars or glitter in a rock quarry. Two two-tone metallic colorways: Gold on Cream, Gold on Charcoal.<br/><br/>Sustainable materials. The Graffito collection of hand-printed wallpapers is made with non-VOC water-based inks, printed on sustainably harvested pulp paper with a natural clay coating. The collection is also available in a variety of Type II commercial-grade options including Mylar, Terralon Smooth and Smooth Vinyl (all low VOC).

From 10,000 feet above the earth, a variety of shapes, colors and sizes come together to make an idyllic patchwork quilt-like scene, which directly inspired Fireclay\u2019s designers. <br/><br/>The collection\u2019s eight bold patterns, ranging from linear grids to circular pivots, highlight the dynamic yet structured patchwork of fields, while its three colorways are representative of land use in the region, as well as the elements of nature that are key to agricultural production: the Warm motif pays homage to the earth and soil, the Cool motif the rain, and the White Motif the sun and sky.<br/><br/>The Agrarian collection also represents Fireclay\u2019s commitment to sustainability, environmentally friendly manufacturing processes, and the preservation of Aromas\u2019 natural beauty by using resourced local materials. <br/><br/>These large-format 8x8\u201d tiles are painted by hand with 100% lead-free glazes on a Fireclay's signature Recycled [red] clay body, which is made up of a minimum of 50% recycled products including post-consumer recycled porcelain and glass, as well as pre-consumer recycled granite dust. In addition, the brand recycles their own tile and glaze waste to be re-incorporated into their recycled clay bodies. <br/><br/>The collection's geometric designs are ideal for creating impactful focal points in residential and commercial environments alike \u2013 mix-and-match for a unique tile landscape, or choose a single pattern to create a striking feature installation. <br/><br/>The Agrarian Collection is suitable for both indoor and outdoor use in temperate climates, and for flooring as well as wall surfacing applications. However one chooses to use Agrarian, the collection\u2019s versatile patterns and color motifs offer endless possibilities for self-expression, while simultaneously telling the story of Fireclay Tile and the place that makes its story possible. <br/><br/>For more information and images, please visit: https://www.fireclaytile.com/handpainted/agrarian/.",

The intricacies and veining reproduced in this series create an authentic marble appearance without the high cost and maintenance. Classentino Marble helps designers looking for a cohesive look achieve an elegant and seamless transition from floors to walls. <br/>In addition to its stunning beauty, Classentino Marble is low maintenance, which is ideal for high-traffic residential or commercial areas. Because porcelain is naturally water, liquid and stain resistant, this tile will sustain its appearance through years of impact. Combining these porcelain qualities with proper installation \u2013 designers can rest assured that this collection will last for years and require minimal repairs during its lifespan. <br/>As trendy as it is sturdy, Classentino Marble meets designer needs for realistic marble patterns with a variety of finishes, mosaics and trims. The color palette for Classentino Marble boasts five versatile options in both matte and polished finishes. The signature veining of marble is intricately reproduced using Reveal Imaging\u00ae\u00a0technology. This state-of-the-art digital printing allows tile to perfectly emulate surfaces and textures found in nature. When combined with other technologies during the glazing process, Reveal Imaging can develop 3D-style visuals that are almost indistinguishable from real minerals. Incredible color and detail come to the surface of every tile through this process, setting these products apart from industry competitors. TruEdge\u2122 technology reduces the overall appearance of grout lines in the surfaces, resulting in a sleek and lavish fa\u00e7ade.<br/>The Marazzi design team focuses on both design and creativity when curating collections to deliver the best-in-class wallcovering and flooring solutions to customers. Classentino Marble offers an aesthetic rooted in Italian heritage and artistically combines the best of both old and new marble surfaces. The matte and polished finishes give customers the ability to find a look that takes their designs to new heights. <br/>Classentino Marble is also available in classic weave and linear hex mosaic styles. Making a profound statement on walls, these mosaics can be used as an accent to the collection or to add a personal touch to surfaces. The available coordinating trims also give contractors the ability to seal off the tile edges, providing a cleaner finish to project spaces. <br/>Whether you are designing your dream kitchen or a bathroom oasis, Classentino Marble serves as the ultimate tile choice for trusted performance and a luxurious touch.",

On the one hand, this has had the beneficial outcome of quality standards absolutely inconceivable until the recent past, but on the other it has often led to worries about the risk \u2013 intrinsic in a virtually \u201cperfect\u201d modular, mass-produced product \u2013 of minimising, or even completely eliminating, the stimulating visual variety once created by the sequential repetition of ceramic tiles when every one had its own, individual flaws.<br/>With the Cromatica collection, Formafantasma investigates fresh possibilities provided by the \u201ccolour factor\u201d in contemporary ceramics manufacturing, while at the same time meeting the need to provide continuous spreads of covering, technically perfect but still offering the fascinating potential for compositions of individual pieces which are never monotonous. The entire collection \u2013 produced in a variety of sizes \u2013 includes six basic colours, with two types of surface finish (one natural, the other glossy); the slab production cycle combines different technologies to deliver a rich lexicon of shades and gradations on the large surface of a single ceramic panel: the small sizes in the collection, \"offcuts\" from the larger slabs, are combined \u2013 even at random \u2013 to create compositions with a wide variety of colours, for design schemes featuring unique, original chromatic blends.<br/>The colour range developed for Cromatica is the outcome of in-depth design work conducted by Formafantasma with the aid of materials from the CEDIT archives; amongst the initial inspirations which stimulated the two designers\u2019 creativity in their search for a concept which could combine the brand\u2019s past with its near future, pride of place must definitely go to the major \u201ccolour definition\u201d work reflected by the \u201c41 Colors\u201d collection of glazed tiles, designed for the company by Ettore Sottsass at the end of the last century.",

The choice to bring an encaustic collection into the ANN SACKS fold was never far from Wearstler\u2019s mind from the very beginning of this partnership. \u201cI admire the beauty of encaustic tile-making, its textural layers of clay and organic variations of color and pattern,\u201d said Wearstler. \u201cI have collected these tiles over the years and been inspired by their individuality and explore the historic technique and reinterpret it in an altogether modern way.\u201d<br/><br/>The making of encaustic tiles is a time-honored, centuries\u2019 old technique that combine a mixture of cement, sand, ground marble and pigments, then fired to seal the design. The pattern is not produced by the glaze but instead by combining two or more colors of the clay achieving an appearance of being an inlaid design, with a surface softly worn and timeless in appeal.<br/><br/> Elope features a layered solid color face broken by a series of curved lines that rake across the backdrop. \u201cElope is organic and fluid, classic with a modern mood,\u201d explained Wearstler. \u201cIt celebrates the soulful anomalies of organic form.\u201d The design is available in three colors: Ebony, a stark Black field with White rake; Azure, a deep Navy field with White rake; and, Oatmeal, a warm Taupe field with White rake.<br/><br/>The second tile is Swell, a seemingly simple striae design at first but actually quite complex in execution as each gently curved line varies in placement and thickness for a visually expressive tile. \u201cSwell is a painterly stripe of radiating, evolving curvatures, its face defined in soft lineage with a relaxed playful geometry,\u201d explained Wearstler. A two-shade color palette of Ebony, a stark Black field with White stripes; Azure, a deep Navy field with White stripes; and, Ivory, a creamy White field with Black stripes.<br/><br/>Rounding out Gem is Evoke, a remarkable pattern that mimics the swirl and shifting face of marble. \u201cTrue touch of the hand detail with heavy brushstrokes defines Evoke,\u201d said Wearstler. \u201cIt is a bold statement, full of movement and dual-tone line-work reminiscent of linocut prints. Evoke\u2019s color palette is Ebony, a deep Black field with White marbling; Azure, a deep Navy field with White marbling; and, Ivory, a creamy White field with Black marbling.<br/><br/>Gem by Kelly Wearstler for ANN SACKS is available in 8\u201dx8\u201d tiles and appropriate for all indoor wall and flooring applications. Outdoor use is subject to climate and method of installation with special emphasis that in exterior applications the tiles may experience some fading over time due to UV exposure, especially in the darker color combinations. The precision sizing allows for exceptionally tight grout lines for an almost seamless end result. The tiles capture and retain heat naturally, the gentle warmth making it an excellent choice for radiant heat flooring.",

            "description_html": "The MechoSystems WhisperShade\u00ae DC Electronic Drive Unit is the powerful and very quiet low-voltage motor for shades that\u2019s compatible with the MechoNet\u2122 operating system used in roller shade automation. The WhisperShade DC motor offers addressing, customizable preset shade positions and rotation speed. The motor features built-in networking capability and can be used in locations where other MechoSystems motors are used or in areas that require a DC powered motor. The special bracket system insures virtually silent operation.<br/><br/>The WhisperShade DC Electronic Drive unit offers designers and specifiers another motor to choose from when specifying shading systems. Now, in addition to line-voltage, the new low-voltage motor will offer superior lifting capability (40 pounds, shade at a max height of 24 feet), while being super quiet! <br/><br/>The addressing functions and compatibility with MehcoNet\u2122 ensure shade automations for office or whole-building can be done effectively. The DC motor will enable many more installations of motorized or automated shades due to easier installation and not needing electrical service at 120VAC. Shade control can be done automatically, by wired switch, or by wireless switch. The motor features a soft start and stop and a variable speed control and 16 preset positions for precise shade alignment. The motor is virtually silent and tests &lt;38Db. Control can be done via local switching (wired or wireless) or via commands sent on the network via the unique address each motor will have. Networking also easily enables zoning of motors when under central control. A complete family of power supply options are available ranging from discrete power supply transformers to a ten-unit power panel. <br/> <br/>The low voltage WhisperShade DC Electronic Drive Unit enables shade automation to occur in spaces where the installation of line voltage motors was difficult due to professional electrician labor expenses or due to construction issues dictated by the pre-wiring for 120 VAC powered roller shade motors. Shade automation fosters daylight integration which saves energy and the use of daylight promotes circadian rhythm and combat Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Promoting Daylight is often an earned LEED point.<br/><br/>The unique DC motor offers support, tight edge clearance and is designed to minimize vibration and noise via coupling to building structure. The minimal edge clearance (7/8 inch) is same at drive, idle, and center support brackets resulting in a symmetrical placement on the window. The movement of the shade motor when installed with the special DC bracket results in a noise measurement of &lt;38db. The matched sound-absorbing brackets are available with or without a clip for Fascia.",
